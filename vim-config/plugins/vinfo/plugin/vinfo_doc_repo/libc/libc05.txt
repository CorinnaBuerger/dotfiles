     'pwrite' and so transparently replaces the 32 bit interface.

13.3 Setting the File Position of a Descriptor
=====-----------------------------------------

Just as you can set the file position of a stream with 'fseek', you can
set the file position of a descriptor with 'lseek'.  This specifies the
position in the file for the next 'read' or 'write' operation.  *Note
File Positioning::, for more information on the file position and what
it means.

   To read the current file position value from a descriptor, use 'lseek
(DESC, 0, SEEK_CUR)'.

 -- Function: off_t lseek (int FILEDES, off_t OFFSET, int WHENCE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'lseek' function is used to change the file position of the
     file with descriptor FILEDES.

     The WHENCE argument specifies how the OFFSET should be interpreted,
     in the same way as for the 'fseek' function, and it must be one of
     the symbolic constants 'SEEK_SET', 'SEEK_CUR', or 'SEEK_END'.

     'SEEK_SET'
          Specifies that OFFSET is a count of characters from the
          beginning of the file.

     'SEEK_CUR'
          Specifies that OFFSET is a count of characters from the
          current file position.  This count may be positive or
          negative.

     'SEEK_END'
          Specifies that OFFSET is a count of characters from the end of
          the file.  A negative count specifies a position within the
          current extent of the file; a positive count specifies a
          position past the current end.  If you set the position past
          the current end, and actually write data, you will extend the
          file with zeros up to that position.

     The return value from 'lseek' is normally the resulting file
     position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file.  You
     can use this feature together with 'SEEK_CUR' to read the current
     file position.

     If you want to append to the file, setting the file position to the
     current end of file with 'SEEK_END' is not sufficient.  Another
     process may write more data after you seek but before you write,
     extending the file so the position you write onto clobbers their
     data.  Instead, use the 'O_APPEND' operating mode; *note Operating
     Modes::.

     You can set the file position past the current end of the file.
     This does not by itself make the file longer; 'lseek' never changes
     the file.  But subsequent output at that position will extend the
     file.  Characters between the previous end of file and the new
     position are filled with zeros.  Extending the file in this way can
     create a "hole": the blocks of zeros are not actually allocated on
     disk, so the file takes up less space than it appears to; it is
     then called a "sparse file".

     If the file position cannot be changed, or the operation is in some
     way invalid, 'lseek' returns a value of -1.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES is not a valid file descriptor.

     'EINVAL'
          The WHENCE argument value is not valid, or the resulting file
          offset is not valid.  A file offset is invalid.

     'ESPIPE'
          The FILEDES corresponds to an object that cannot be
          positioned, such as a pipe, FIFO or terminal device.  (POSIX.1
          specifies this error only for pipes and FIFOs, but on GNU
          systems, you always get 'ESPIPE' if the object is not
          seekable.)

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'lseek' function is in fact 'lseek64' and the type 'off_t' has 64
     bits which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63 bytes in
     length.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.
     This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like
     memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time
     'lseek' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources
     stay allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this calls to
     'lseek' should be protected using cancellation handlers.

     The 'lseek' function is the underlying primitive for the 'fseek',
     'fseeko', 'ftell', 'ftello' and 'rewind' functions, which operate
     on streams instead of file descriptors.

 -- Function: off64_t lseek64 (int FILEDES, off64_t OFFSET, int WHENCE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'lseek' function.  The difference
     is that the OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t' instead of
     'off_t' which makes it possible on 32 bit machines to address files
     larger than 2^31 bytes and up to 2^63 bytes.  The file descriptor
     'filedes' must be opened using 'open64' since otherwise the large
     offsets possible with 'off64_t' will lead to errors with a
     descriptor in small file mode.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bits machine this function is actually available under the
     name 'lseek' and so transparently replaces the 32 bit interface.

   You can have multiple descriptors for the same file if you open the
file more than once, or if you duplicate a descriptor with 'dup'.
Descriptors that come from separate calls to 'open' have independent
file positions; using 'lseek' on one descriptor has no effect on the
other.  For example,

     {
       int d1, d2;
       char buf[4];
       d1 = open ("foo", O_RDONLY);
       d2 = open ("foo", O_RDONLY);
       lseek (d1, 1024, SEEK_SET);
       read (d2, buf, 4);
     }

will read the first four characters of the file 'foo'.  (The
error-checking code necessary for a real program has been omitted here
for brevity.)

   By contrast, descriptors made by duplication share a common file
position with the original descriptor that was duplicated.  Anything
which alters the file position of one of the duplicates, including
reading or writing data, affects all of them alike.  Thus, for example,

     {
       int d1, d2, d3;
       char buf1[4], buf2[4];
       d1 = open ("foo", O_RDONLY);
       d2 = dup (d1);
       d3 = dup (d2);
       lseek (d3, 1024, SEEK_SET);
       read (d1, buf1, 4);
       read (d2, buf2, 4);
     }

will read four characters starting with the 1024'th character of 'foo',
and then four more characters starting with the 1028'th character.

 -- Data Type: off_t

     This is a signed integer type used to represent file sizes.  In the
     GNU C Library, this type is no narrower than 'int'.

     If the source is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this type
     is transparently replaced by 'off64_t'.

 -- Data Type: off64_t

     This type is used similar to 'off_t'.  The difference is that even
     on 32 bit machines, where the 'off_t' type would have 32 bits,
     'off64_t' has 64 bits and so is able to address files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     When compiling with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this type is
     available under the name 'off_t'.

   These aliases for the 'SEEK_...' constants exist for the sake of
compatibility with older BSD systems.  They are defined in two different
header files: 'fcntl.h' and 'sys/file.h'.

'L_SET'
     An alias for 'SEEK_SET'.

'L_INCR'
     An alias for 'SEEK_CUR'.

'L_XTND'
     An alias for 'SEEK_END'.

13.4 Descriptors and Streams
=====-----------------------

Given an open file descriptor, you can create a stream for it with the
'fdopen' function.  You can get the underlying file descriptor for an
existing stream with the 'fileno' function.  These functions are
declared in the header file 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: FILE * fdopen (int FILEDES, const char *OPENTYPE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap lock | AC-Unsafe mem lock |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'fdopen' function returns a new stream for the file descriptor
     FILEDES.

     The OPENTYPE argument is interpreted in the same way as for the
     'fopen' function (*note Opening Streams::), except that the 'b'
     option is not permitted; this is because GNU systems make no
     distinction between text and binary files.  Also, '"w"' and '"w+"'
     do not cause truncation of the file; these have an effect only when
     opening a file, and in this case the file has already been opened.
     You must make sure that the OPENTYPE argument matches the actual
     mode of the open file descriptor.

     The return value is the new stream.  If the stream cannot be
     created (for example, if the modes for the file indicated by the
     file descriptor do not permit the access specified by the OPENTYPE
     argument), a null pointer is returned instead.

     In some other systems, 'fdopen' may fail to detect that the modes
     for file descriptors do not permit the access specified by
     'opentype'.  The GNU C Library always checks for this.

   For an example showing the use of the 'fdopen' function, see *note
Creating a Pipe::.

 -- Function: int fileno (FILE *STREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function returns the file descriptor associated with the
     stream STREAM.  If an error is detected (for example, if the STREAM
     is not valid) or if STREAM does not do I/O to a file, 'fileno'
     returns -1.

 -- Function: int fileno_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'fileno_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fileno'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream if the
     state is 'FSETLOCKING_INTERNAL'.

     This function is a GNU extension.

   There are also symbolic constants defined in 'unistd.h' for the file
descriptors belonging to the standard streams 'stdin', 'stdout', and
'stderr'; see *note Standard Streams::.

'STDIN_FILENO'

     This macro has value '0', which is the file descriptor for standard
     input.

'STDOUT_FILENO'

     This macro has value '1', which is the file descriptor for standard
     output.

'STDERR_FILENO'

     This macro has value '2', which is the file descriptor for standard
     error output.

13.5 Dangers of Mixing Streams and Descriptors
=====-----------------------------------------

You can have multiple file descriptors and streams (let's call both
streams and descriptors "channels" for short) connected to the same
file, but you must take care to avoid confusion between channels.  There
are two cases to consider: "linked" channels that share a single file
position value, and "independent" channels that have their own file
positions.

   It's best to use just one channel in your program for actual data
transfer to any given file, except when all the access is for input.
For example, if you open a pipe (something you can only do at the file
descriptor level), either do all I/O with the descriptor, or construct a
stream from the descriptor with 'fdopen' and then do all I/O with the
stream.

13.5.1 Linked Channels
----------------------

Channels that come from a single opening share the same file position;
we call them "linked" channels.  Linked channels result when you make a
stream from a descriptor using 'fdopen', when you get a descriptor from
a stream with 'fileno', when you copy a descriptor with 'dup' or 'dup2',
and when descriptors are inherited during 'fork'.  For files that don't
support random access, such as terminals and pipes, _all_ channels are
effectively linked.  On random-access files, all append-type output
streams are effectively linked to each other.

   If you have been using a stream for I/O (or have just opened the
stream), and you want to do I/O using another channel (either a stream
or a descriptor) that is linked to it, you must first "clean up" the
stream that you have been using.  *Note Cleaning Streams::.

   Terminating a process, or executing a new program in the process,
destroys all the streams in the process.  If descriptors linked to these
streams persist in other processes, their file positions become
undefined as a result.  To prevent this, you must clean up the streams
before destroying them.

13.5.2 Independent Channels
---------------------------

When you open channels (streams or descriptors) separately on a seekable
file, each channel has its own file position.  These are called
"independent channels".

   The system handles each channel independently.  Most of the time,
this is quite predictable and natural (especially for input): each
channel can read or write sequentially at its own place in the file.
However, if some of the channels are streams, you must take these
precautions:

   * You should clean an output stream after use, before doing anything
     else that might read or write from the same part of the file.

   * You should clean an input stream before reading data that may have
     been modified using an independent channel.  Otherwise, you might
     read obsolete data that had been in the stream's buffer.

   If you do output to one channel at the end of the file, this will
certainly leave the other independent channels positioned somewhere
before the new end.  You cannot reliably set their file positions to the
new end of file before writing, because the file can always be extended
by another process between when you set the file position and when you
write the data.  Instead, use an append-type descriptor or stream; they
always output at the current end of the file.  In order to make the
end-of-file position accurate, you must clean the output channel you
were using, if it is a stream.

   It's impossible for two channels to have separate file pointers for a
file that doesn't support random access.  Thus, channels for reading or
writing such files are always linked, never independent.  Append-type
channels are also always linked.  For these channels, follow the rules
for linked channels; see *note Linked Channels::.

13.5.3 Cleaning Streams
-----------------------

You can use 'fflush' to clean a stream in most cases.

   You can skip the 'fflush' if you know the stream is already clean.  A
stream is clean whenever its buffer is empty.  For example, an
unbuffered stream is always clean.  An input stream that is at
end-of-file is clean.  A line-buffered stream is clean when the last
character output was a newline.  However, a just-opened input stream
might not be clean, as its input buffer might not be empty.

   There is one case in which cleaning a stream is impossible on most
systems.  This is when the stream is doing input from a file that is not
random-access.  Such streams typically read ahead, and when the file is
not random access, there is no way to give back the excess data already
read.  When an input stream reads from a random-access file, 'fflush'
does clean the stream, but leaves the file pointer at an unpredictable
place; you must set the file pointer before doing any further I/O.

   Closing an output-only stream also does 'fflush', so this is a valid
way of cleaning an output stream.

   You need not clean a stream before using its descriptor for control
operations such as setting terminal modes; these operations don't affect
the file position and are not affected by it.  You can use any
descriptor for these operations, and all channels are affected
simultaneously.  However, text already "output" to a stream but still
buffered by the stream will be subject to the new terminal modes when
subsequently flushed.  To make sure "past" output is covered by the
terminal settings that were in effect at the time, flush the output
streams for that terminal before setting the modes.  *Note Terminal

13.6 Fast Scatter-Gather I/O
=====-----------------------

Some applications may need to read or write data to multiple buffers,
which are separated in memory.  Although this can be done easily enough
with multiple calls to 'read' and 'write', it is inefficient because
there is overhead associated with each kernel call.

   Instead, many platforms provide special high-speed primitives to
perform these "scatter-gather" operations in a single kernel call.  The
GNU C Library will provide an emulation on any system that lacks these
primitives, so they are not a portability threat.  They are defined in
'sys/uio.h'.

   These functions are controlled with arrays of 'iovec' structures,
which describe the location and size of each buffer.

 -- Data Type: struct iovec

     The 'iovec' structure describes a buffer.  It contains two fields:

     'void *iov_base'
          Contains the address of a buffer.

     'size_t iov_len'
          Contains the length of the buffer.

 -- Function: ssize_t readv (int FILEDES, const struct iovec *VECTOR,
          int COUNT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'readv' function reads data from FILEDES and scatters it into
     the buffers described in VECTOR, which is taken to be COUNT
     structures long.  As each buffer is filled, data is sent to the
     next.

     Note that 'readv' is not guaranteed to fill all the buffers.  It
     may stop at any point, for the same reasons 'read' would.

     The return value is a count of bytes (_not_ buffers) read, 0
     indicating end-of-file, or -1 indicating an error.  The possible
     errors are the same as in 'read'.

 -- Function: ssize_t writev (int FILEDES, const struct iovec *VECTOR,
          int COUNT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'writev' function gathers data from the buffers described in
     VECTOR, which is taken to be COUNT structures long, and writes them
     to 'filedes'.  As each buffer is written, it moves on to the next.

     Like 'readv', 'writev' may stop midstream under the same conditions
     'write' would.

     The return value is a count of bytes written, or -1 indicating an
     error.  The possible errors are the same as in 'write'.

 -- Function: ssize_t preadv (int FD, const struct iovec *IOV, int
          IOVCNT, off_t OFFSET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'readv' function, with the
     difference it adds an extra OFFSET parameter of type 'off_t'
     similar to 'pread'.  The data is written to the file starting at
     position OFFSET.  The position of the file descriptor itself is not
     affected by the operation.  The value is the same as before the
     call.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'preadv' function is in fact 'preadv64' and the type 'off_t' has 64
     bits, which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63 bytes in
     length.

     The return value is a count of bytes (_not_ buffers) read, 0
     indicating end-of-file, or -1 indicating an error.  The possible
     errors are the same as in 'readv' and 'pread'.

 -- Function: ssize_t preadv64 (int FD, const struct iovec *IOV, int
          IOVCNT, off64_t OFFSET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'preadv' function with the
     difference is that the OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t'
     instead of 'off_t'.  It makes it possible on 32 bit machines to
     address files larger than 2^31 bytes and up to 2^63 bytes.  The
     file descriptor 'filedes' must be opened using 'open64' since
     otherwise the large offsets possible with 'off64_t' will lead to
     errors with a descriptor in small file mode.

     When the source file is compiled using '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bit machine this function is actually available under the name
     'preadv' and so transparently replaces the 32 bit interface.

 -- Function: ssize_t pwritev (int FD, const struct iovec *IOV, int
          IOVCNT, off_t OFFSET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'writev' function, with the
     difference it adds an extra OFFSET parameter of type 'off_t'
     similar to 'pwrite'.  The data is written to the file starting at
     position OFFSET.  The position of the file descriptor itself is not
     affected by the operation.  The value is the same as before the
     call.

     However, on Linux, if a file is opened with 'O_APPEND', 'pwrite'
     appends data to the end of the file, regardless of the value of
     'offset'.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'pwritev' function is in fact 'pwritev64' and the type 'off_t' has
     64 bits, which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63 bytes
     in length.

     The return value is a count of bytes (_not_ buffers) written, 0
     indicating end-of-file, or -1 indicating an error.  The possible
     errors are the same as in 'writev' and 'pwrite'.

 -- Function: ssize_t pwritev64 (int FD, const struct iovec *IOV, int
          IOVCNT, off64_t OFFSET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'pwritev' function with the
     difference is that the OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t'
     instead of 'off_t'.  It makes it possible on 32 bit machines to
     address files larger than 2^31 bytes and up to 2^63 bytes.  The
     file descriptor 'filedes' must be opened using 'open64' since
     otherwise the large offsets possible with 'off64_t' will lead to
     errors with a descriptor in small file mode.

     When the source file is compiled using '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bit machine this function is actually available under the name
     'pwritev' and so transparently replaces the 32 bit interface.

 -- Function: ssize_t preadv2 (int FD, const struct iovec *IOV, int
          IOVCNT, off_t OFFSET, int FLAGS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'preadv' function, with the
     difference it adds an extra FLAGS parameter of type 'int'.
     Additionally, if OFFSET is -1, the current file position is used
     and updated (like the 'readv' function).

     The supported FLAGS are dependent of the underlying system.  For
     Linux it supports:

     'RWF_HIPRI'
          High priority request.  This adds a flag that tells the file
          system that this is a high priority request for which it is
          worth to poll the hardware.  The flag is purely advisory and
          can be ignored if not supported.  The FD must be opened using
          'O_DIRECT'.

     'RWF_DSYNC'
          Per-IO synchronization as if the file was opened with
          'O_DSYNC' flag.

     'RWF_SYNC'
          Per-IO synchronization as if the file was opened with 'O_SYNC'
          flag.

     'RWF_NOWAIT'
          Use nonblocking mode for this operation; that is, this call to
          'preadv2' will fail and set 'errno' to 'EAGAIN' if the
          operation would block.

     'RWF_APPEND'
          Per-IO synchronization as if the file was opened with
          'O_APPEND' flag.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'preadv2' function is in fact 'preadv64v2' and the type 'off_t' has
     64 bits, which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63 bytes
     in length.

     The return value is a count of bytes (_not_ buffers) read, 0
     indicating end-of-file, or -1 indicating an error.  The possible
     errors are the same as in 'preadv' with the addition of:

     'EOPNOTSUPP'

          An unsupported FLAGS was used.

 -- Function: ssize_t preadv64v2 (int FD, const struct iovec *IOV, int
          IOVCNT, off64_t OFFSET, int FLAGS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'preadv2' function with the
     difference is that the OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t'
     instead of 'off_t'.  It makes it possible on 32 bit machines to
     address files larger than 2^31 bytes and up to 2^63 bytes.  The
     file descriptor 'filedes' must be opened using 'open64' since

 -- Function: ssize_t pwritev2 (int FD, const struct iovec *IOV, int
          IOVCNT, off_t OFFSET, int FLAGS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety

     This function is similar to the 'pwritev' function, with the
     difference it adds an extra FLAGS parameter of type 'int'.
     Additionally, if OFFSET is -1, the current file position should is
     used and updated (like the 'writev' function).

     The supported FLAGS are dependent of the underlying system.  For

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'pwritev2' function is in fact 'pwritev64v2' and the type 'off_t'
     has 64 bits, which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     The return value is a count of bytes (_not_ buffers) write, 0
     indicating end-of-file, or -1 indicating an error.  The possible
     errors are the same as in 'preadv2'.

13.7 Copying data between two files
=====------------------------------

A special function is provided to copy data between two files on the
same file system.  The system can optimize such copy operations.  This
is particularly important on network file systems, where the data would
otherwise have to be transferred twice over the network.

   Note that this function only copies file data, but not metadata such
as file permissions or extended attributes.

 -- Function: ssize_t copy_file_range (int INPUTFD, off64_t *INPUTPOS,
          int OUTPUTFD, off64_t *OUTPUTPOS, ssize_t LENGTH, unsigned int
          FLAGS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function copies up to LENGTH bytes from the file descriptor
     INPUTFD to the file descriptor OUTPUTFD.

     The function can operate on both the current file position (like
     'read' and 'write') and an explicit offset (like 'pread' and
     'pwrite').  If the INPUTPOS pointer is null, the file position of
     INPUTFD is used as the starting point of the copy operation, and
     the file position is advanced during it.  If INPUTPOS is not null,
     then '*INPUTPOS' is used as the starting point of the copy
     operation, and '*INPUTPOS' is incremented by the number of copied
     bytes, but the file position remains unchanged.  Similar rules
     apply to OUTPUTFD and OUTPUTPOS for the output file position.

     The FLAGS argument is currently reserved and must be zero.

     The 'copy_file_range' function returns the number of bytes copied.
     This can be less than the specified LENGTH in case the input file
     contains fewer remaining bytes than LENGTH, or if a read or write
     failure occurs.  The return value is zero if the end of the input
     file is encountered immediately.

     If no bytes can be copied, to report an error, 'copy_file_range'
     returns the value -1 and sets 'errno'.  The following 'errno' error
     conditions are specific to this function:

     'EISDIR'
          At least one of the descriptors INPUTFD or OUTPUTFD refers to
          a directory.

     'EINVAL'
          At least one of the descriptors INPUTFD or OUTPUTFD refers to
          a non-regular, non-directory file (such as a socket or a
          FIFO).

          The input or output positions before are after the copy
          operations are outside of an implementation-defined limit.

          The FLAGS argument is not zero.

     'EFBIG'
          The new file size would exceed the process file size limit.
          *Note Limits on Resources::.

          The input or output positions before are after the copy
          operations are outside of an implementation-defined limit.
          This can happen if the file was not opened with large file
          support (LFS) on 32-bit machines, and the copy operation would
          create a file which is larger than what 'off_t' could
          represent.

     'EBADF'
          The argument INPUTFD is not a valid file descriptor open for
          reading.

          The argument OUTPUTFD is not a valid file descriptor open for
          writing, or OUTPUTFD has been opened with 'O_APPEND'.

     'EXDEV'
          The input and output files reside on different file systems.

     In addition, 'copy_file_range' can fail with the error codes which
     are used by 'read', 'pread', 'write', and 'pwrite'.

     The 'copy_file_range' function is a cancellation point.  In case of
     cancellation, the input location (the file position or the value at
     '*INPUTPOS') is indeterminate.

13.8 Memory-mapped I/O
=====-----------------

On modern operating systems, it is possible to "mmap" (pronounced
"em-map") a file to a region of memory.  When this is done, the file can
be accessed just like an array in the program.

   This is more efficient than 'read' or 'write', as only the regions of
the file that a program actually accesses are loaded.  Accesses to
not-yet-loaded parts of the mmapped region are handled in the same way
as swapped out pages.

   Since mmapped pages can be stored back to their file when physical
memory is low, it is possible to mmap files orders of magnitude larger
than both the physical memory _and_ swap space.  The only limit is
address space.  The theoretical limit is 4GB on a 32-bit machine -
however, the actual limit will be smaller since some areas will be
reserved for other purposes.  If the LFS interface is used the file size
on 32-bit systems is not limited to 2GB (offsets are signed which
reduces the addressable area of 4GB by half); the full 64-bit are
available.

   Memory mapping only works on entire pages of memory.  Thus, addresses
for mapping must be page-aligned, and length values will be rounded up.
To determine the default size of a page the machine uses one should use:

     size_t page_size = (size_t) sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE);

   On some systems, mappings can use larger page sizes for certain
files, and applications can request larger page sizes for anonymous
mappings as well (see the 'MAP_HUGETLB' flag below).

   The following functions are declared in 'sys/mman.h':

 -- Function: void * mmap (void *ADDRESS, size_t LENGTH, int PROTECT,
          int FLAGS, int FILEDES, off_t OFFSET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'mmap' function creates a new mapping, connected to bytes
     (OFFSET) to (OFFSET + LENGTH - 1) in the file open on FILEDES.  A
     new reference for the file specified by FILEDES is created, which
     is not removed by closing the file.

     ADDRESS gives a preferred starting address for the mapping.  'NULL'
     expresses no preference.  Any previous mapping at that address is
     automatically removed.  The address you give may still be changed,
     unless you use the 'MAP_FIXED' flag.

     PROTECT contains flags that control what kind of access is
     permitted.  They include 'PROT_READ', 'PROT_WRITE', and
     'PROT_EXEC'.  The special flag 'PROT_NONE' reserves a region of
     address space for future use.  The 'mprotect' function can be used
     to change the protection flags.  *Note Memory Protection::.

     FLAGS contains flags that control the nature of the map.  One of
     'MAP_SHARED' or 'MAP_PRIVATE' must be specified.

     They include:

     'MAP_PRIVATE'
          This specifies that writes to the region should never be
          written back to the attached file.  Instead, a copy is made
          for the process, and the region will be swapped normally if
          memory runs low.  No other process will see the changes.

          Since private mappings effectively revert to ordinary memory
          when written to, you must have enough virtual memory for a
          copy of the entire mmapped region if you use this mode with
          'PROT_WRITE'.

     'MAP_SHARED'
          This specifies that writes to the region will be written back
          to the file.  Changes made will be shared immediately with
          other processes mmaping the same file.

          Note that actual writing may take place at any time.  You need
          to use 'msync', described below, if it is important that other
          processes using conventional I/O get a consistent view of the
          file.

     'MAP_FIXED'
          This forces the system to use the exact mapping address
          specified in ADDRESS and fail if it can't.

     'MAP_ANONYMOUS'
     'MAP_ANON'
          This flag tells the system to create an anonymous mapping, not
          connected to a file.  FILEDES and OFFSET are ignored, and the
          region is initialized with zeros.

          Anonymous maps are used as the basic primitive to extend the
          heap on some systems.  They are also useful to share data
          between multiple tasks without creating a file.

          On some systems using private anonymous mmaps is more
          efficient than using 'malloc' for large blocks.  This is not
          an issue with the GNU C Library, as the included 'malloc'
          automatically uses 'mmap' where appropriate.

     'MAP_HUGETLB'

          This requests that the system uses an alternative page size
          which is larger than the default page size for the mapping.
          For some workloads, increasing the page size for large
          mappings improves performance because the system needs to
          handle far fewer pages.  For other workloads which require
          frequent transfer of pages between storage or different nodes,
          the decreased page granularity may cause performance problems
          due to the increased page size and larger transfers.

          In order to create the mapping, the system needs physically
          contiguous memory of the size of the increased page size.  As
          a result, 'MAP_HUGETLB' mappings are affected by memory
          fragmentation, and their creation can fail even if plenty of
          memory is available in the system.

          Not all file systems support mappings with an increased page
          size.

          The 'MAP_HUGETLB' flag is specific to Linux.

     'mmap' returns the address of the new mapping, or 'MAP_FAILED' for
     an error.

     Possible errors include:

     'EINVAL'

          Either ADDRESS was unusable (because it is not a multiple of
          the applicable page size), or inconsistent FLAGS were given.

          If 'MAP_HUGETLB' was specified, the file or system does not
          support large page sizes.

     'EACCES'

          FILEDES was not open for the type of access specified in
          PROTECT.

     'ENOMEM'

          Either there is not enough memory for the operation, or the
          process is out of address space.

     'ENODEV'

          This file is of a type that doesn't support mapping.

     'ENOEXEC'

          The file is on a filesystem that doesn't support mapping.

 -- Function: void * mmap64 (void *ADDRESS, size_t LENGTH, int PROTECT,
          int FLAGS, int FILEDES, off64_t OFFSET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'mmap64' function is equivalent to the 'mmap' function but the
     OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t'.  On 32-bit systems this
     allows the file associated with the FILEDES descriptor to be larger
     than 2GB. FILEDES must be a descriptor returned from a call to
     'open64' or 'fopen64' and 'freopen64' where the descriptor is
     retrieved with 'fileno'.

     When the sources are translated with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is actually available under the name 'mmap'.  I.e., the
     new, extended API using 64 bit file sizes and offsets transparently
     replaces the old API.

 -- Function: int munmap (void *ADDR, size_t LENGTH)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     'munmap' removes any memory maps from (ADDR) to (ADDR + LENGTH).
     LENGTH should be the length of the mapping.

     It is safe to unmap multiple mappings in one command, or include
     unmapped space in the range.  It is also possible to unmap only
     part of an existing mapping.  However, only entire pages can be
     removed.  If LENGTH is not an even number of pages, it will be
     rounded up.

     It returns 0 for success and -1 for an error.

     One error is possible:

     'EINVAL'
          The memory range given was outside the user mmap range or
          wasn't page aligned.

 -- Function: int msync (void *ADDRESS, size_t LENGTH, int FLAGS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     When using shared mappings, the kernel can write the file at any
     time before the mapping is removed.  To be certain data has
     actually been written to the file and will be accessible to
     non-memory-mapped I/O, it is necessary to use this function.

     It operates on the region ADDRESS to (ADDRESS + LENGTH).  It may be
     used on part of a mapping or multiple mappings, however the region
     given should not contain any unmapped space.

     FLAGS can contain some options:

     'MS_SYNC'

          This flag makes sure the data is actually written _to disk_.
          Normally 'msync' only makes sure that accesses to a file with
          conventional I/O reflect the recent changes.

     'MS_ASYNC'

          This tells 'msync' to begin the synchronization, but not to
          wait for it to complete.

     'msync' returns 0 for success and -1 for error.  Errors include:

     'EINVAL'
          An invalid region was given, or the FLAGS were invalid.

     'EFAULT'
          There is no existing mapping in at least part of the given
          region.

 -- Function: void * mremap (void *ADDRESS, size_t LENGTH, size_t
          NEW_LENGTH, int FLAG)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function can be used to change the size of an existing memory
     area.  ADDRESS and LENGTH must cover a region entirely mapped in
     the same 'mmap' statement.  A new mapping with the same
     characteristics will be returned with the length NEW_LENGTH.

     One option is possible, 'MREMAP_MAYMOVE'.  If it is given in FLAGS,
     the system may remove the existing mapping and create a new one of
     the desired length in another location.

     The address of the resulting mapping is returned, or -1.  Possible
     error codes include:

     'EFAULT'
          There is no existing mapping in at least part of the original
          region, or the region covers two or more distinct mappings.

     'EINVAL'
          The address given is misaligned or inappropriate.

     'EAGAIN'
          The region has pages locked, and if extended it would exceed
          the process's resource limit for locked pages.  *Note Limits
          on Resources::.

     'ENOMEM'
          The region is private writable, and insufficient virtual
          memory is available to extend it.  Also, this error will occur
          if 'MREMAP_MAYMOVE' is not given and the extension would
          collide with another mapped region.

   This function is only available on a few systems.  Except for
performing optional optimizations one should not rely on this function.

   Not all file descriptors may be mapped.  Sockets, pipes, and most
devices only allow sequential access and do not fit into the mapping
abstraction.  In addition, some regular files may not be mmapable, and
older kernels may not support mapping at all.  Thus, programs using
'mmap' should have a fallback method to use should it fail.  *Note
(standards)Mmap::.

 -- Function: int madvise (void *ADDR, size_t LENGTH, int ADVICE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function can be used to provide the system with ADVICE about
     the intended usage patterns of the memory region starting at ADDR
     and extending LENGTH bytes.

     The valid BSD values for ADVICE are:

     'MADV_NORMAL'
          The region should receive no further special treatment.

     'MADV_RANDOM'
          The region will be accessed via random page references.  The
          kernel should page-in the minimal number of pages for each
          page fault.

     'MADV_SEQUENTIAL'
          The region will be accessed via sequential page references.
          This may cause the kernel to aggressively read-ahead,
          expecting further sequential references after any page fault
          within this region.

     'MADV_WILLNEED'
          The region will be needed.  The pages within this region may
          be pre-faulted in by the kernel.

     'MADV_DONTNEED'
          The region is no longer needed.  The kernel may free these
          pages, causing any changes to the pages to be lost, as well as
          swapped out pages to be discarded.

     'MADV_HUGEPAGE'

          Indicate that it is beneficial to increase the page size for
          this mapping.  This can improve performance for larger
          mappings because the system needs to handle far fewer pages.
          However, if parts of the mapping are frequently transferred
          between storage or different nodes, performance may suffer
          because individual transfers can become substantially larger
          due to the increased page size.

          This flag is specific to Linux.

     'MADV_NOHUGEPAGE'
          Undo the effect of a previous 'MADV_HUGEPAGE' advice.  This
          flag is specific to Linux.

     The POSIX names are slightly different, but with the same meanings:

     'POSIX_MADV_NORMAL'
          This corresponds with BSD's 'MADV_NORMAL'.

     'POSIX_MADV_RANDOM'
          This corresponds with BSD's 'MADV_RANDOM'.

     'POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL'
          This corresponds with BSD's 'MADV_SEQUENTIAL'.

     'POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED'
          This corresponds with BSD's 'MADV_WILLNEED'.

     'POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED'
          This corresponds with BSD's 'MADV_DONTNEED'.

     'madvise' returns 0 for success and -1 for error.  Errors include:

     'EINVAL'
          An invalid region was given, or the ADVICE was invalid.

     'EFAULT'
          There is no existing mapping in at least part of the given
          region.

 -- Function: int shm_open (const char *NAME, int OFLAG, mode_t MODE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe init heap lock |
     AC-Unsafe lock mem fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns a file descriptor that can be used to
     allocate shared memory via mmap.  Unrelated processes can use same
     NAME to create or open existing shared memory objects.

     A NAME argument specifies the shared memory object to be opened.
     In the GNU C Library it must be a string smaller than 'NAME_MAX'
     bytes starting with an optional slash but containing no other
     slashes.

     The semantics of OFLAG and MODE arguments is same as in 'open'.

     'shm_open' returns the file descriptor on success or -1 on error.
     On failure 'errno' is set.

 -- Function: int shm_unlink (const char *NAME)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe init heap lock |
     AC-Unsafe lock mem fd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is the inverse of 'shm_open' and removes the object
     with the given NAME previously created by 'shm_open'.

     'shm_unlink' returns 0 on success or -1 on error.  On failure
     'errno' is set.

 -- Function: int memfd_create (const char *NAME, unsigned int FLAGS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'memfd_create' function returns a file descriptor which can be
     used to create memory mappings using the 'mmap' function.  It is
     similar to the 'shm_open' function in the sense that these mappings
     are not backed by actual files.  However, the descriptor returned
     by 'memfd_create' does not correspond to a named object; the NAME
     argument is used for debugging purposes only (e.g., will appear in
     '/proc'), and separate invocations of 'memfd_create' with the same
     NAME will not return descriptors for the same region of memory.
     The descriptor can also be used to create alias mappings within the
     same process.

     The descriptor initially refers to a zero-length file.  Before
     mappings can be created which are backed by memory, the file size
     needs to be increased with the 'ftruncate' function.  *Note File
     Size::.

     The FLAGS argument can be a combination of the following flags:

     'MFD_CLOEXEC'

          The descriptor is created with the 'O_CLOEXEC' flag.

     'MFD_ALLOW_SEALING'

          The descriptor supports the addition of seals using the
          'fcntl' function.

     'MFD_HUGETLB'

          This requests that mappings created using the returned file
          descriptor use a larger page size.  See 'MAP_HUGETLB' above
          for details.

          This flag is incompatible with 'MFD_ALLOW_SEALING'.

     'memfd_create' returns a file descriptor on success, and -1 on
     failure.

     The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

     'EINVAL'
          An invalid combination is specified in FLAGS, or NAME is too
          long.

     'EFAULT'
          The NAME argument does not point to a string.

     'EMFILE'
          The operation would exceed the file descriptor limit for this
          process.

     'ENFILE'
          The operation would exceed the system-wide file descriptor
          limit.

     'ENOMEM'
          There is not enough memory for the operation.

13.9 Waiting for Input or Output
=====---------------------------

Sometimes a program needs to accept input on multiple input channels
whenever input arrives.  For example, some workstations may have devices
such as a digitizing tablet, function button box, or dial box that are
connected via normal asynchronous serial interfaces; good user interface
style requires responding immediately to input on any device.  Another
example is a program that acts as a server to several other processes
via pipes or sockets.

   You cannot normally use 'read' for this purpose, because this blocks
the program until input is available on one particular file descriptor;
input on other channels won't wake it up.  You could set nonblocking
mode and poll each file descriptor in turn, but this is very
inefficient.

   A better solution is to use the 'select' function.  This blocks the
program until input or output is ready on a specified set of file
descriptors, or until a timer expires, whichever comes first.  This
facility is declared in the header file 'sys/types.h'.

   In the case of a server socket (*note Listening::), we say that
"input" is available when there are pending connections that could be
accepted (*note Accepting Connections::).  'accept' for server sockets
blocks and interacts with 'select' just as 'read' does for normal input.

   The file descriptor sets for the 'select' function are specified as
'fd_set' objects.  Here is the description of the data type and some
macros for manipulating these objects.

 -- Data Type: fd_set

     The 'fd_set' data type represents file descriptor sets for the
     'select' function.  It is actually a bit array.

 -- Macro: int FD_SETSIZE

     The value of this macro is the maximum number of file descriptors
     that a 'fd_set' object can hold information about.  On systems with
     a fixed maximum number, 'FD_SETSIZE' is at least that number.  On
     some systems, including GNU, there is no absolute limit on the
     number of descriptors open, but this macro still has a constant
     value which controls the number of bits in an 'fd_set'; if you get
     a file descriptor with a value as high as 'FD_SETSIZE', you cannot
     put that descriptor into an 'fd_set'.

 -- Macro: void FD_ZERO (fd_set *SET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:set | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This macro initializes the file descriptor set SET to be the empty
     set.

 -- Macro: void FD_SET (int FILEDES, fd_set *SET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:set | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This macro adds FILEDES to the file descriptor set SET.

     The FILEDES parameter must not have side effects since it is
     evaluated more than once.

 -- Macro: void FD_CLR (int FILEDES, fd_set *SET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:set | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This macro removes FILEDES from the file descriptor set SET.

     The FILEDES parameter must not have side effects since it is
     evaluated more than once.

 -- Macro: int FD_ISSET (int FILEDES, const fd_set *SET)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:set | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This macro returns a nonzero value (true) if FILEDES is a member of
     the file descriptor set SET, and zero (false) otherwise.

     The FILEDES parameter must not have side effects since it is
     evaluated more than once.

   Next, here is the description of the 'select' function itself.

 -- Function: int select (int NFDS, fd_set *READ-FDS, fd_set *WRITE-FDS,
          fd_set *EXCEPT-FDS, struct timeval *TIMEOUT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe race:read-fds race:write-fds race:except-fds
     | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'select' function blocks the calling process until there is
     activity on any of the specified sets of file descriptors, or until
     the timeout period has expired.

     The file descriptors specified by the READ-FDS argument are checked
     to see if they are ready for reading; the WRITE-FDS file
     descriptors are checked to see if they are ready for writing; and
     the EXCEPT-FDS file descriptors are checked for exceptional
     conditions.  You can pass a null pointer for any of these arguments
     if you are not interested in checking for that kind of condition.

     A file descriptor is considered ready for reading if a 'read' call
     will not block.  This usually includes the read offset being at the
     end of the file or there is an error to report.  A server socket is
     considered ready for reading if there is a pending connection which
     can be accepted with 'accept'; *note Accepting Connections::.  A
     client socket is ready for writing when its connection is fully
     established; *note Connecting::.

     "Exceptional conditions" does not mean errors--errors are reported
     immediately when an erroneous system call is executed, and do not
     constitute a state of the descriptor.  Rather, they include
     conditions such as the presence of an urgent message on a socket.
     (*Note Sockets::, for information on urgent messages.)

     The 'select' function checks only the first NFDS file descriptors.
     The usual thing is to pass 'FD_SETSIZE' as the value of this
     argument.

     The TIMEOUT specifies the maximum time to wait.  If you pass a null
     pointer for this argument, it means to block indefinitely until one
     of the file descriptors is ready.  Otherwise, you should provide
     the time in 'struct timeval' format; see *note High-Resolution
     Calendar::.  Specify zero as the time (a 'struct timeval'
     containing all zeros) if you want to find out which descriptors are
     ready without waiting if none are ready.

     The normal return value from 'select' is the total number of ready
     file descriptors in all of the sets.  Each of the argument sets is
     overwritten with information about the descriptors that are ready
     for the corresponding operation.  Thus, to see if a particular
     descriptor DESC has input, use 'FD_ISSET (DESC, READ-FDS)' after
     'select' returns.

     If 'select' returns because the timeout period expires, it returns
     a value of zero.

     Any signal will cause 'select' to return immediately.  So if your
     program uses signals, you can't rely on 'select' to keep waiting
     for the full time specified.  If you want to be sure of waiting for
     a particular amount of time, you must check for 'EINTR' and repeat
     the 'select' with a newly calculated timeout based on the current
     time.  See the example below.  See also *note Interrupted
     Primitives::.

     If an error occurs, 'select' returns '-1' and does not modify the
     argument file descriptor sets.  The following 'errno' error
     conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          One of the file descriptor sets specified an invalid file
          descriptor.

     'EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal.  *Note Interrupted
          Primitives::.

     'EINVAL'
          The TIMEOUT argument is invalid; one of the components is
          negative or too large.

   *Portability Note:* The 'select' function is a BSD Unix feature.

   Here is an example showing how you can use 'select' to establish a
timeout period for reading from a file descriptor.  The 'input_timeout'
function blocks the calling process until input is available on the file
descriptor, or until the timeout period expires.


     #include <errno.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/time.h>

     int
     input_timeout (int filedes, unsigned int seconds)
     {
       fd_set set;
       struct timeval timeout;

       /* Initialize the file descriptor set. */
       FD_ZERO (&set);
       FD_SET (filedes, &set);

       /* Initialize the timeout data structure. */
       timeout.tv_sec = seconds;
       timeout.tv_usec = 0;

       /* 'select' returns 0 if timeout, 1 if input available, -1 if error. */
       return TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (select (FD_SETSIZE,
                                          &set, NULL, NULL,
                                          &timeout));
     }

     int
     main (void)
     {
       fprintf (stderr, "select returned %d.\n",
                input_timeout (STDIN_FILENO, 5));
       return 0;
     }

   There is another example showing the use of 'select' to multiplex
input from multiple sockets in *note Server Example::.

13.10 Synchronizing I/O operations
=====-----------------------------

In most modern operating systems, the normal I/O operations are not
executed synchronously.  I.e., even if a 'write' system call returns,
this does not mean the data is actually written to the media, e.g., the
disk.

   In situations where synchronization points are necessary, you can use
special functions which ensure that all operations finish before they
return.

 -- Function: void sync (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     A call to this function will not return as long as there is data
     which has not been written to the device.  All dirty buffers in the
     kernel will be written and so an overall consistent system can be
     achieved (if no other process in parallel writes data).

     A prototype for 'sync' can be found in 'unistd.h'.

   Programs more often want to ensure that data written to a given file
is committed, rather than all data in the system.  For this, 'sync' is
overkill.

 -- Function: int fsync (int FILDES)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'fsync' function can be used to make sure all data associated
     with the open file FILDES is written to the device associated with
     the descriptor.  The function call does not return unless all
     actions have finished.

     A prototype for 'fsync' can be found in 'unistd.h'.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.
     This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like
     memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time
     'fsync' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources
     stay allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this, calls to
     'fsync' should be protected using cancellation handlers.

     The return value of the function is zero if no error occurred.
     Otherwise it is -1 and the global variable ERRNO is set to the
     following values:
     'EBADF'
          The descriptor FILDES is not valid.

     'EINVAL'
          No synchronization is possible since the system does not
          implement this.

   Sometimes it is not even necessary to write all data associated with
a file descriptor.  E.g., in database files which do not change in size
it is enough to write all the file content data to the device.
Meta-information, like the modification time etc., are not that
important and leaving such information uncommitted does not prevent a
successful recovery of the file in case of a problem.

 -- Function: int fdatasync (int FILDES)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     When a call to the 'fdatasync' function returns, it is ensured that
     all of the file data is written to the device.  For all pending I/O
     operations, the parts guaranteeing data integrity finished.

     Not all systems implement the 'fdatasync' operation.  On systems
     missing this functionality 'fdatasync' is emulated by a call to
     'fsync' since the performed actions are a superset of those
     required by 'fdatasync'.

     The prototype for 'fdatasync' is in 'unistd.h'.

     The return value of the function is zero if no error occurred.
     Otherwise it is -1 and the global variable ERRNO is set to the
     following values:
     'EBADF'
          The descriptor FILDES is not valid.

     'EINVAL'
          No synchronization is possible since the system does not
          implement this.

13.11 Perform I/O Operations in Parallel
=====-----------------------------------

The POSIX.1b standard defines a new set of I/O operations which can
significantly reduce the time an application spends waiting for I/O. The
new functions allow a program to initiate one or more I/O operations and
then immediately resume normal work while the I/O operations are
executed in parallel.  This functionality is available if the 'unistd.h'
file defines the symbol '_POSIX_ASYNCHRONOUS_IO'.

   These functions are part of the library with realtime functions named
'librt'.  They are not actually part of the 'libc' binary.  The
implementation of these functions can be done using support in the
kernel (if available) or using an implementation based on threads at
userlevel.  In the latter case it might be necessary to link
applications with the thread library 'libpthread' in addition to
'librt'.

   All AIO operations operate on files which were opened previously.
There might be arbitrarily many operations running for one file.  The
asynchronous I/O operations are controlled using a data structure named
'struct aiocb' ("AIO control block").  It is defined in 'aio.h' as
follows.

 -- Data Type: struct aiocb

     The POSIX.1b standard mandates that the 'struct aiocb' structure
     contains at least the members described in the following table.
     There might be more elements which are used by the implementation,
     but depending upon these elements is not portable and is highly
     deprecated.

     'int aio_fildes'
          This element specifies the file descriptor to be used for the
          operation.  It must be a legal descriptor, otherwise the
          operation will fail.

          The device on which the file is opened must allow the seek
          operation.  I.e., it is not possible to use any of the AIO
          operations on devices like terminals where an 'lseek' call
          would lead to an error.

     'off_t aio_offset'
          This element specifies the offset in the file at which the
          operation (input or output) is performed.  Since the
          operations are carried out in arbitrary order and more than
          one operation for one file descriptor can be started, one
          cannot expect a current read/write position of the file
          descriptor.

     'volatile void *aio_buf'
          This is a pointer to the buffer with the data to be written or
          the place where the read data is stored.

     'size_t aio_nbytes'
          This element specifies the length of the buffer pointed to by
          'aio_buf'.

     'int aio_reqprio'
          If the platform has defined '_POSIX_PRIORITIZED_IO' and
          '_POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING', the AIO requests are processed
          based on the current scheduling priority.  The 'aio_reqprio'
          element can then be used to lower the priority of the AIO
          operation.

     'struct sigevent aio_sigevent'
          This element specifies how the calling process is notified
          once the operation terminates.  If the 'sigev_notify' element
          is 'SIGEV_NONE', no notification is sent.  If it is
          'SIGEV_SIGNAL', the signal determined by 'sigev_signo' is
          sent.  Otherwise, 'sigev_notify' must be 'SIGEV_THREAD'.  In
          this case, a thread is created which starts executing the
          function pointed to by 'sigev_notify_function'.

     'int aio_lio_opcode'
          This element is only used by the 'lio_listio' and
          'lio_listio64' functions.  Since these functions allow an
          arbitrary number of operations to start at once, and each
          operation can be input or output (or nothing), the information
          must be stored in the control block.  The possible values are:

          'LIO_READ'
               Start a read operation.  Read from the file at position
               'aio_offset' and store the next 'aio_nbytes' bytes in the
               buffer pointed to by 'aio_buf'.

          'LIO_WRITE'
               Start a write operation.  Write 'aio_nbytes' bytes
               starting at 'aio_buf' into the file starting at position
               'aio_offset'.

          'LIO_NOP'
               Do nothing for this control block.  This value is useful
               sometimes when an array of 'struct aiocb' values contains
               holes, i.e., some of the values must not be handled
               although the whole array is presented to the 'lio_listio'
               function.

     When the sources are compiled using '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32 bit machine, this type is in fact 'struct aiocb64', since the
     LFS interface transparently replaces the 'struct aiocb' definition.

   For use with the AIO functions defined in the LFS, there is a similar
type defined which replaces the types of the appropriate members with
larger types but otherwise is equivalent to 'struct aiocb'.
Particularly, all member names are the same.

 -- Data Type: struct aiocb64

     'int aio_fildes'
          This element specifies the file descriptor which is used for
          the operation.  It must be a legal descriptor since otherwise
          the operation fails for obvious reasons.

          The device on which the file is opened must allow the seek
          operation.  I.e., it is not possible to use any of the AIO
          operations on devices like terminals where an 'lseek' call
          would lead to an error.

     'off64_t aio_offset'
          This element specifies at which offset in the file the
          operation (input or output) is performed.  Since the operation
          are carried in arbitrary order and more than one operation for
          one file descriptor can be started, one cannot expect a
          current read/write position of the file descriptor.

     'volatile void *aio_buf'
          This is a pointer to the buffer with the data to be written or
          the place where the read data is stored.

     'size_t aio_nbytes'
          This element specifies the length of the buffer pointed to by
          'aio_buf'.

     'int aio_reqprio'
          If for the platform '_POSIX_PRIORITIZED_IO' and
          '_POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING' are defined the AIO requests are
          processed based on the current scheduling priority.  The
          'aio_reqprio' element can then be used to lower the priority
          of the AIO operation.

     'struct sigevent aio_sigevent'
          This element specifies how the calling process is notified
          once the operation terminates.  If the 'sigev_notify' element
          is 'SIGEV_NONE' no notification is sent.  If it is
          'SIGEV_SIGNAL', the signal determined by 'sigev_signo' is
          sent.  Otherwise, 'sigev_notify' must be 'SIGEV_THREAD' in
          which case a thread is created which starts executing the
          function pointed to by 'sigev_notify_function'.

     'int aio_lio_opcode'
          This element is only used by the 'lio_listio' and
          'lio_listio64' functions.  Since these functions allow an
          arbitrary number of operations to start at once, and since
          each operation can be input or output (or nothing), the
          information must be stored in the control block.  See the
          description of 'struct aiocb' for a description of the
          possible values.

     When the sources are compiled using '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32 bit machine, this type is available under the name 'struct
     aiocb64', since the LFS transparently replaces the old interface.

13.11.1 Asynchronous Read and Write Operations
----------------------------------------------

 -- Function: int aio_read (struct aiocb *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function initiates an asynchronous read operation.  It
     immediately returns after the operation was enqueued or when an
     error was encountered.

     The first 'aiocbp->aio_nbytes' bytes of the file for which
     'aiocbp->aio_fildes' is a descriptor are written to the buffer
     starting at 'aiocbp->aio_buf'.  Reading starts at the absolute
     position 'aiocbp->aio_offset' in the file.

     If prioritized I/O is supported by the platform the
     'aiocbp->aio_reqprio' value is used to adjust the priority before
     the request is actually enqueued.

     The calling process is notified about the termination of the read
     request according to the 'aiocbp->aio_sigevent' value.

     When 'aio_read' returns, the return value is zero if no error
     occurred that can be found before the process is enqueued.  If such
     an early error is found, the function returns -1 and sets 'errno'
     to one of the following values:

     'EAGAIN'
          The request was not enqueued due to (temporarily) exceeded
          resource limitations.
     'ENOSYS'
          The 'aio_read' function is not implemented.
     'EBADF'
          The 'aiocbp->aio_fildes' descriptor is not valid.  This
          condition need not be recognized before enqueueing the request
          and so this error might also be signaled asynchronously.
     'EINVAL'
          The 'aiocbp->aio_offset' or 'aiocbp->aio_reqpiro' value is
          invalid.  This condition need not be recognized before
          enqueueing the request and so this error might also be
          signaled asynchronously.

     If 'aio_read' returns zero, the current status of the request can
     be queried using 'aio_error' and 'aio_return' functions.  As long
     as the value returned by 'aio_error' is 'EINPROGRESS' the operation
     has not yet completed.  If 'aio_error' returns zero, the operation
     successfully terminated, otherwise the value is to be interpreted
     as an error code.  If the function terminated, the result of the
     operation can be obtained using a call to 'aio_return'.  The
     returned value is the same as an equivalent call to 'read' would
     have returned.  Possible error codes returned by 'aio_error' are:

     'EBADF'
          The 'aiocbp->aio_fildes' descriptor is not valid.
     'ECANCELED'
          The operation was canceled before the operation was finished
          (*note Cancel AIO Operations::)
     'EINVAL'
          The 'aiocbp->aio_offset' value is invalid.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is in fact 'aio_read64' since the LFS interface
     transparently replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int aio_read64 (struct aiocb64 *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'aio_read' function.  The only
     difference is that on 32 bit machines, the file descriptor should
     be opened in the large file mode.  Internally, 'aio_read64' uses
     functionality equivalent to 'lseek64' (*note File Position
     Primitive::) to position the file descriptor correctly for the
     reading, as opposed to the 'lseek' functionality used in
     'aio_read'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64', this
     function is available under the name 'aio_read' and so
     transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
     machines.

   To write data asynchronously to a file, there exists an equivalent
pair of functions with a very similar interface.

 -- Function: int aio_write (struct aiocb *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function initiates an asynchronous write operation.  The
     function call immediately returns after the operation was enqueued
     or if before this happens an error was encountered.

     The first 'aiocbp->aio_nbytes' bytes from the buffer starting at
     'aiocbp->aio_buf' are written to the file for which
     'aiocbp->aio_fildes' is a descriptor, starting at the absolute
     position 'aiocbp->aio_offset' in the file.

     If prioritized I/O is supported by the platform, the
     'aiocbp->aio_reqprio' value is used to adjust the priority before
     the request is actually enqueued.

     The calling process is notified about the termination of the read
     request according to the 'aiocbp->aio_sigevent' value.

     When 'aio_write' returns, the return value is zero if no error
     occurred that can be found before the process is enqueued.  If such
     an early error is found the function returns -1 and sets 'errno' to
     one of the following values.

     'EAGAIN'
          The request was not enqueued due to (temporarily) exceeded
          resource limitations.
     'ENOSYS'
          The 'aio_write' function is not implemented.
     'EBADF'
          The 'aiocbp->aio_fildes' descriptor is not valid.  This
          condition may not be recognized before enqueueing the request,
          and so this error might also be signaled asynchronously.
     'EINVAL'
          The 'aiocbp->aio_offset' or 'aiocbp->aio_reqprio' value is
          invalid.  This condition may not be recognized before
          enqueueing the request and so this error might also be
          signaled asynchronously.

     In the case 'aio_write' returns zero, the current status of the
     request can be queried using the 'aio_error' and 'aio_return'
     functions.  As long as the value returned by 'aio_error' is
     'EINPROGRESS' the operation has not yet completed.  If 'aio_error'
     returns zero, the operation successfully terminated, otherwise the
     value is to be interpreted as an error code.  If the function
     terminated, the result of the operation can be obtained using a
     call to 'aio_return'.  The returned value is the same as an
     equivalent call to 'read' would have returned.  Possible error
     codes returned by 'aio_error' are:

     'EBADF'
          The 'aiocbp->aio_fildes' descriptor is not valid.
     'ECANCELED'
          The operation was canceled before the operation was finished.
          (*note Cancel AIO Operations::)
     'EINVAL'
          The 'aiocbp->aio_offset' value is invalid.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64', this
     function is in fact 'aio_write64' since the LFS interface
     transparently replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int aio_write64 (struct aiocb64 *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'aio_write' function.  The only
     difference is that on 32 bit machines the file descriptor should be
     opened in the large file mode.  Internally 'aio_write64' uses
     functionality equivalent to 'lseek64' (*note File Position
     Primitive::) to position the file descriptor correctly for the
     writing, as opposed to the 'lseek' functionality used in
     'aio_write'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64', this
     function is available under the name 'aio_write' and so
     transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
     machines.

   Besides these functions with the more or less traditional interface,
POSIX.1b also defines a function which can initiate more than one
operation at a time, and which can handle freely mixed read and write
operations.  It is therefore similar to a combination of 'readv' and
'writev'.

 -- Function: int lio_listio (int MODE, struct aiocb *const LIST[], int
          NENT, struct sigevent *SIG)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'lio_listio' function can be used to enqueue an arbitrary
     number of read and write requests at one time.  The requests can
     all be meant for the same file, all for different files or every
     solution in between.

     'lio_listio' gets the NENT requests from the array pointed to by
     LIST.  The operation to be performed is determined by the
     'aio_lio_opcode' member in each element of LIST.  If this field is
     'LIO_READ' a read operation is enqueued, similar to a call of
     'aio_read' for this element of the array (except that the way the
     termination is signalled is different, as we will see below).  If
     the 'aio_lio_opcode' member is 'LIO_WRITE' a write operation is
     enqueued.  Otherwise the 'aio_lio_opcode' must be 'LIO_NOP' in
     which case this element of LIST is simply ignored.  This
     "operation" is useful in situations where one has a fixed array of
     'struct aiocb' elements from which only a few need to be handled at
     a time.  Another situation is where the 'lio_listio' call was
     canceled before all requests are processed (*note Cancel AIO
     Operations::) and the remaining requests have to be reissued.

     The other members of each element of the array pointed to by 'list'
     must have values suitable for the operation as described in the
     documentation for 'aio_read' and 'aio_write' above.

     The MODE argument determines how 'lio_listio' behaves after having
     enqueued all the requests.  If MODE is 'LIO_WAIT' it waits until
     all requests terminated.  Otherwise MODE must be 'LIO_NOWAIT' and
     in this case the function returns immediately after having enqueued
     all the requests.  In this case the caller gets a notification of
     the termination of all requests according to the SIG parameter.  If
     SIG is 'NULL' no notification is sent.  Otherwise a signal is sent
     or a thread is started, just as described in the description for
     'aio_read' or 'aio_write'.

     If MODE is 'LIO_WAIT', the return value of 'lio_listio' is 0 when
     all requests completed successfully.  Otherwise the function
     returns -1 and 'errno' is set accordingly.  To find out which
     request or requests failed one has to use the 'aio_error' function
     on all the elements of the array LIST.

     In case MODE is 'LIO_NOWAIT', the function returns 0 if all
     requests were enqueued correctly.  The current state of the
     requests can be found using 'aio_error' and 'aio_return' as
     described above.  If 'lio_listio' returns -1 in this mode, the
     global variable 'errno' is set accordingly.  If a request did not
     yet terminate, a call to 'aio_error' returns 'EINPROGRESS'.  If the
     value is different, the request is finished and the error value (or
     0) is returned and the result of the operation can be retrieved
     using 'aio_return'.

     Possible values for 'errno' are:

     'EAGAIN'
          The resources necessary to queue all the requests are not
          available at the moment.  The error status for each element of
          LIST must be checked to determine which request failed.

          Another reason could be that the system wide limit of AIO
          requests is exceeded.  This cannot be the case for the
          implementation on GNU systems since no arbitrary limits exist.
     'EINVAL'
          The MODE parameter is invalid or NENT is larger than
          'AIO_LISTIO_MAX'.
     'EIO'
          One or more of the request's I/O operations failed.  The error
          status of each request should be checked to determine which
          one failed.
     'ENOSYS'
          The 'lio_listio' function is not supported.

     If the MODE parameter is 'LIO_NOWAIT' and the caller cancels a
     request, the error status for this request returned by 'aio_error'
     is 'ECANCELED'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64', this
     function is in fact 'lio_listio64' since the LFS interface
     transparently replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int lio_listio64 (int MODE, struct aiocb64 *const LIST[],
          int NENT, struct sigevent *SIG)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'lio_listio' function.  The only
     difference is that on 32 bit machines, the file descriptor should
     be opened in the large file mode.  Internally, 'lio_listio64' uses
     functionality equivalent to 'lseek64' (*note File Position
     Primitive::) to position the file descriptor correctly for the
     reading or writing, as opposed to the 'lseek' functionality used in
     'lio_listio'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64', this
     function is available under the name 'lio_listio' and so
     transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
     machines.

13.11.2 Getting the Status of AIO Operations
--------------------------------------------

As already described in the documentation of the functions in the last
section, it must be possible to get information about the status of an
I/O request.  When the operation is performed truly asynchronously (as
with 'aio_read' and 'aio_write' and with 'lio_listio' when the mode is
'LIO_NOWAIT'), one sometimes needs to know whether a specific request
already terminated and if so, what the result was.  The following two
functions allow you to get this kind of information.

 -- Function: int aio_error (const struct aiocb *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function determines the error state of the request described
     by the 'struct aiocb' variable pointed to by AIOCBP.  If the
     request has not yet terminated the value returned is always
     'EINPROGRESS'.  Once the request has terminated the value
     'aio_error' returns is either 0 if the request completed
     successfully or it returns the value which would be stored in the
     'errno' variable if the request would have been done using 'read',
     'write', or 'fsync'.

     The function can return 'ENOSYS' if it is not implemented.  It
     could also return 'EINVAL' if the AIOCBP parameter does not refer
     to an asynchronous operation whose return status is not yet known.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is in fact 'aio_error64' since the LFS interface
     transparently replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int aio_error64 (const struct aiocb64 *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'aio_error' with the only difference
     that the argument is a reference to a variable of type 'struct
     aiocb64'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is available under the name 'aio_error' and so
     transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
     machines.

 -- Function: ssize_t aio_return (struct aiocb *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function can be used to retrieve the return status of the
     operation carried out by the request described in the variable
     pointed to by AIOCBP.  As long as the error status of this request
     as returned by 'aio_error' is 'EINPROGRESS' the return value of
     this function is undefined.

     Once the request is finished this function can be used exactly once
     to retrieve the return value.  Following calls might lead to
     undefined behavior.  The return value itself is the value which
     would have been returned by the 'read', 'write', or 'fsync' call.

     The function can return 'ENOSYS' if it is not implemented.  It
     could also return 'EINVAL' if the AIOCBP parameter does not refer
     to an asynchronous operation whose return status is not yet known.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is in fact 'aio_return64' since the LFS interface
     transparently replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: ssize_t aio_return64 (struct aiocb64 *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'aio_return' with the only difference
     that the argument is a reference to a variable of type 'struct
     aiocb64'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is available under the name 'aio_return' and so
     transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
     machines.

13.11.3 Getting into a Consistent State
---------------------------------------

When dealing with asynchronous operations it is sometimes necessary to
get into a consistent state.  This would mean for AIO that one wants to
know whether a certain request or a group of requests were processed.
This could be done by waiting for the notification sent by the system
after the operation terminated, but this sometimes would mean wasting
resources (mainly computation time).  Instead POSIX.1b defines two
functions which will help with most kinds of consistency.

   The 'aio_fsync' and 'aio_fsync64' functions are only available if the
symbol '_POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO' is defined in 'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int aio_fsync (int OP, struct aiocb *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     Calling this function forces all I/O operations queued at the time
     of the function call operating on the file descriptor
     'aiocbp->aio_fildes' into the synchronized I/O completion state
     (*note Synchronizing I/O::).  The 'aio_fsync' function returns
     immediately but the notification through the method described in
     'aiocbp->aio_sigevent' will happen only after all requests for this
     file descriptor have terminated and the file is synchronized.  This
     also means that requests for this very same file descriptor which
     are queued after the synchronization request are not affected.

     If OP is 'O_DSYNC' the synchronization happens as with a call to
     'fdatasync'.  Otherwise OP should be 'O_SYNC' and the
     synchronization happens as with 'fsync'.

     As long as the synchronization has not happened, a call to
     'aio_error' with the reference to the object pointed to by AIOCBP
     returns 'EINPROGRESS'.  Once the synchronization is done
     'aio_error' return 0 if the synchronization was not successful.
     Otherwise the value returned is the value to which the 'fsync' or
     'fdatasync' function would have set the 'errno' variable.  In this
     case nothing can be assumed about the consistency of the data
     written to this file descriptor.

     The return value of this function is 0 if the request was
     successfully enqueued.  Otherwise the return value is -1 and
     'errno' is set to one of the following values:

     'EAGAIN'
          The request could not be enqueued due to temporary lack of
          resources.
     'EBADF'
          The file descriptor 'AIOCBP->aio_fildes' is not valid.
     'EINVAL'
          The implementation does not support I/O synchronization or the
          OP parameter is other than 'O_DSYNC' and 'O_SYNC'.
     'ENOSYS'
          This function is not implemented.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is in fact 'aio_fsync64' since the LFS interface
     transparently replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int aio_fsync64 (int OP, struct aiocb64 *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'aio_fsync' with the only difference
     that the argument is a reference to a variable of type 'struct
     aiocb64'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is available under the name 'aio_fsync' and so
     transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
     machines.

   Another method of synchronization is to wait until one or more
requests of a specific set terminated.  This could be achieved by the
'aio_*' functions to notify the initiating process about the termination
but in some situations this is not the ideal solution.  In a program
which constantly updates clients somehow connected to the server it is
not always the best solution to go round robin since some connections
might be slow.  On the other hand letting the 'aio_*' functions notify
the caller might also be not the best solution since whenever the
process works on preparing data for a client it makes no sense to be
interrupted by a notification since the new client will not be handled
before the current client is served.  For situations like this
'aio_suspend' should be used.

 -- Function: int aio_suspend (const struct aiocb *const LIST[], int
          NENT, const struct timespec *TIMEOUT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     When calling this function, the calling thread is suspended until
     at least one of the requests pointed to by the NENT elements of the
     array LIST has completed.  If any of the requests has already
     completed at the time 'aio_suspend' is called, the function returns
     immediately.  Whether a request has terminated or not is determined
     by comparing the error status of the request with 'EINPROGRESS'.
     If an element of LIST is 'NULL', the entry is simply ignored.

     If no request has finished, the calling process is suspended.  If
     TIMEOUT is 'NULL', the process is not woken until a request has
     finished.  If TIMEOUT is not 'NULL', the process remains suspended
     at least as long as specified in TIMEOUT.  In this case,
     'aio_suspend' returns with an error.

     The return value of the function is 0 if one or more requests from
     the LIST have terminated.  Otherwise the function returns -1 and
     'errno' is set to one of the following values:

     'EAGAIN'
          None of the requests from the LIST completed in the time
          specified by TIMEOUT.
     'EINTR'
          A signal interrupted the 'aio_suspend' function.  This signal
          might also be sent by the AIO implementation while signalling
          the termination of one of the requests.
     'ENOSYS'
          The 'aio_suspend' function is not implemented.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is in fact 'aio_suspend64' since the LFS interface
     transparently replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int aio_suspend64 (const struct aiocb64 *const LIST[], int
          NENT, const struct timespec *TIMEOUT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'aio_suspend' with the only difference
     that the argument is a reference to a variable of type 'struct
     aiocb64'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is available under the name 'aio_suspend' and so
     transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
     machines.

13.11.4 Cancellation of AIO Operations
--------------------------------------

When one or more requests are asynchronously processed, it might be
useful in some situations to cancel a selected operation, e.g., if it
becomes obvious that the written data is no longer accurate and would
have to be overwritten soon.  As an example, assume an application,
which writes data in files in a situation where new incoming data would
have to be written in a file which will be updated by an enqueued
request.  The POSIX AIO implementation provides such a function, but
this function is not capable of forcing the cancellation of the request.
It is up to the implementation to decide whether it is possible to
cancel the operation or not.  Therefore using this function is merely a
hint.

 -- Function: int aio_cancel (int FILDES, struct aiocb *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'aio_cancel' function can be used to cancel one or more
     outstanding requests.  If the AIOCBP parameter is 'NULL', the
     function tries to cancel all of the outstanding requests which
     would process the file descriptor FILDES (i.e., whose 'aio_fildes'
     member is FILDES).  If AIOCBP is not 'NULL', 'aio_cancel' attempts
     to cancel the specific request pointed to by AIOCBP.

     For requests which were successfully canceled, the normal
     notification about the termination of the request should take
     place.  I.e., depending on the 'struct sigevent' object which
     controls this, nothing happens, a signal is sent or a thread is
     started.  If the request cannot be canceled, it terminates the
     usual way after performing the operation.

     After a request is successfully canceled, a call to 'aio_error'
     with a reference to this request as the parameter will return
     'ECANCELED' and a call to 'aio_return' will return -1.  If the
     request wasn't canceled and is still running the error status is
     still 'EINPROGRESS'.

     The return value of the function is 'AIO_CANCELED' if there were
     requests which haven't terminated and which were successfully
     canceled.  If there is one or more requests left which couldn't be
     canceled, the return value is 'AIO_NOTCANCELED'.  In this case
     'aio_error' must be used to find out which of the, perhaps
     multiple, requests (if AIOCBP is 'NULL') weren't successfully
     canceled.  If all requests already terminated at the time
     'aio_cancel' is called the return value is 'AIO_ALLDONE'.

     If an error occurred during the execution of 'aio_cancel' the
     function returns -1 and sets 'errno' to one of the following
     values.

     'EBADF'
          The file descriptor FILDES is not valid.
     'ENOSYS'
          'aio_cancel' is not implemented.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64', this
     function is in fact 'aio_cancel64' since the LFS interface
     transparently replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int aio_cancel64 (int FILDES, struct aiocb64 *AIOCBP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock heap | AC-Unsafe lock mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'aio_cancel' with the only difference
     that the argument is a reference to a variable of type 'struct
     aiocb64'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64', this
     function is available under the name 'aio_cancel' and so
     transparently replaces the interface for small files on 32 bit
     machines.

13.11.5 How to optimize the AIO implementation
----------------------------------------------

The POSIX standard does not specify how the AIO functions are
implemented.  They could be system calls, but it is also possible to
emulate them at userlevel.

   At the time of writing, the available implementation is a user-level
implementation which uses threads for handling the enqueued requests.
While this implementation requires making some decisions about
limitations, hard limitations are something best avoided in the GNU C
Library.  Therefore, the GNU C Library provides a means for tuning the
AIO implementation according to the individual use.

 -- Data Type: struct aioinit

     This data type is used to pass the configuration or tunable
     parameters to the implementation.  The program has to initialize
     the members of this struct and pass it to the implementation using
     the 'aio_init' function.

     'int aio_threads'
          This member specifies the maximal number of threads which may
          be used at any one time.
     'int aio_num'
          This number provides an estimate on the maximal number of
          simultaneously enqueued requests.
     'int aio_locks'
          Unused.
     'int aio_usedba'
          Unused.
     'int aio_debug'
          Unused.
     'int aio_numusers'
          Unused.
     'int aio_reserved[2]'
          Unused.

 -- Function: void aio_init (const struct aioinit *INIT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function must be called before any other AIO function.
     Calling it is completely voluntary, as it is only meant to help the
     AIO implementation perform better.

     Before calling 'aio_init', the members of a variable of type
     'struct aioinit' must be initialized.  Then a reference to this
     variable is passed as the parameter to 'aio_init' which itself may
     or may not pay attention to the hints.

     The function has no return value and no error cases are defined.
     It is an extension which follows a proposal from the SGI
     implementation in Irix 6.  It is not covered by POSIX.1b or Unix98.

13.12 Control Operations on Files
=====----------------------------

This section describes how you can perform various other operations on
file descriptors, such as inquiring about or setting flags describing
the status of the file descriptor, manipulating record locks, and the
like.  All of these operations are performed by the function 'fcntl'.

   The second argument to the 'fcntl' function is a command that
specifies which operation to perform.  The function and macros that name
various flags that are used with it are declared in the header file
'fcntl.h'.  Many of these flags are also used by the 'open' function;
see *note Opening and Closing Files::.

 -- Function: int fcntl (int FILEDES, int COMMAND, ...)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'fcntl' function performs the operation specified by COMMAND on
     the file descriptor FILEDES.  Some commands require additional
     arguments to be supplied.  These additional arguments and the
     return value and error conditions are given in the detailed
     descriptions of the individual commands.

     Briefly, here is a list of what the various commands are.

     'F_DUPFD'
          Duplicate the file descriptor (return another file descriptor
          pointing to the same open file).  *Note Duplicating
          Descriptors::.

     'F_GETFD'
          Get flags associated with the file descriptor.  *Note
          Descriptor Flags::.

     'F_SETFD'
          Set flags associated with the file descriptor.  *Note
          Descriptor Flags::.

     'F_GETFL'
          Get flags associated with the open file.  *Note File Status
          Flags::.

     'F_SETFL'
          Set flags associated with the open file.  *Note File Status
          Flags::.

     'F_GETLK'
          Test a file lock.  *Note File Locks::.

     'F_SETLK'
          Set or clear a file lock.  *Note File Locks::.

     'F_SETLKW'
          Like 'F_SETLK', but wait for completion.  *Note File Locks::.

     'F_OFD_GETLK'
          Test an open file description lock.  *Note Open File
          Description Locks::.  Specific to Linux.

     'F_OFD_SETLK'
          Set or clear an open file description lock.  *Note Open File
          Description Locks::.  Specific to Linux.

     'F_OFD_SETLKW'
          Like 'F_OFD_SETLK', but block until lock is acquired.  *Note
          Open File Description Locks::.  Specific to Linux.

     'F_GETOWN'
          Get process or process group ID to receive 'SIGIO' signals.
          *Note Interrupt Input::.

     'F_SETOWN'
          Set process or process group ID to receive 'SIGIO' signals.
          *Note Interrupt Input::.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs
     for the commands 'F_SETLKW' (and the LFS analogous 'F_SETLKW64')
     and 'F_OFD_SETLKW'.  This is a problem if the thread allocates some
     resources (like memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever)
     at the time 'fcntl' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these
     resources stay allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this
     calls to 'fcntl' should be protected using cancellation handlers.

13.13 Duplicating Descriptors
=====------------------------

You can "duplicate" a file descriptor, or allocate another file
descriptor that refers to the same open file as the original.  Duplicate
descriptors share one file position and one set of file status flags
(*note File Status Flags::), but each has its own set of file descriptor
flags (*note Descriptor Flags::).

   The major use of duplicating a file descriptor is to implement
"redirection" of input or output: that is, to change the file or pipe
that a particular file descriptor corresponds to.

   You can perform this operation using the 'fcntl' function with the
'F_DUPFD' command, but there are also convenient functions 'dup' and
'dup2' for duplicating descriptors.

   The 'fcntl' function and flags are declared in 'fcntl.h', while
prototypes for 'dup' and 'dup2' are in the header file 'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int dup (int OLD)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function copies descriptor OLD to the first available
     descriptor number (the first number not currently open).  It is
     equivalent to 'fcntl (OLD, F_DUPFD, 0)'.

 -- Function: int dup2 (int OLD, int NEW)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function copies the descriptor OLD to descriptor number NEW.

     If OLD is an invalid descriptor, then 'dup2' does nothing; it does
     not close NEW.  Otherwise, the new duplicate of OLD replaces any
     previous meaning of descriptor NEW, as if NEW were closed first.

     If OLD and NEW are different numbers, and OLD is a valid descriptor
     number, then 'dup2' is equivalent to:

          close (NEW);
          fcntl (OLD, F_DUPFD, NEW)

     However, 'dup2' does this atomically; there is no instant in the
     middle of calling 'dup2' at which NEW is closed and not yet a
     duplicate of OLD.

 -- Macro: int F_DUPFD

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to copy the
     file descriptor given as the first argument.

     The form of the call in this case is:

          fcntl (OLD, F_DUPFD, NEXT-FILEDES)

     The NEXT-FILEDES argument is of type 'int' and specifies that the
     file descriptor returned should be the next available one greater
     than or equal to this value.

     The return value from 'fcntl' with this command is normally the
     value of the new file descriptor.  A return value of -1 indicates
     an error.  The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     this command:

     'EBADF'
          The OLD argument is invalid.

     'EINVAL'
          The NEXT-FILEDES argument is invalid.

     'EMFILE'
          There are no more file descriptors available--your program is
          already using the maximum.  In BSD and GNU, the maximum is
          controlled by a resource limit that can be changed; *note
          Limits on Resources::, for more information about the
          'RLIMIT_NOFILE' limit.

     'ENFILE' is not a possible error code for 'dup2' because 'dup2'
     does not create a new opening of a file; duplicate descriptors do
     not count toward the limit which 'ENFILE' indicates.  'EMFILE' is
     possible because it refers to the limit on distinct descriptor
     numbers in use in one process.

   Here is an example showing how to use 'dup2' to do redirection.
Typically, redirection of the standard streams (like 'stdin') is done by
a shell or shell-like program before calling one of the 'exec' functions
(*note Executing a File::) to execute a new program in a child process.
When the new program is executed, it creates and initializes the
standard streams to point to the corresponding file descriptors, before
its 'main' function is invoked.

   So, to redirect standard input to a file, the shell could do
something like:

     pid = fork ();
     if (pid == 0)
       {
         char *filename;
         char *program;
         int file;
         ...
         file = TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (open (filename, O_RDONLY));
         dup2 (file, STDIN_FILENO);
         TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (close (file));
         execv (program, NULL);
       }

   There is also a more detailed example showing how to implement
redirection in the context of a pipeline of processes in *note Launching
Jobs::.

13.14 File Descriptor Flags
=====----------------------

"File descriptor flags" are miscellaneous attributes of a file
descriptor.  These flags are associated with particular file
descriptors, so that if you have created duplicate file descriptors from
a single opening of a file, each descriptor has its own set of flags.

   Currently there is just one file descriptor flag: 'FD_CLOEXEC', which
causes the descriptor to be closed if you use any of the 'exec...'
functions (*note Executing a File::).

   The symbols in this section are defined in the header file 'fcntl.h'.

 -- Macro: int F_GETFD

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should return the file descriptor flags associated with the
     FILEDES argument.

     The normal return value from 'fcntl' with this command is a
     nonnegative number which can be interpreted as the bitwise OR of
     the individual flags (except that currently there is only one flag
     to use).

     In case of an error, 'fcntl' returns -1.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this command:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is invalid.

 -- Macro: int F_SETFD

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should set the file descriptor flags associated with the
     FILEDES argument.  This requires a third 'int' argument to specify
     the new flags, so the form of the call is:

          fcntl (FILEDES, F_SETFD, NEW-FLAGS)

     The normal return value from 'fcntl' with this command is an
     unspecified value other than -1, which indicates an error.  The
     flags and error conditions are the same as for the 'F_GETFD'
     command.

   The following macro is defined for use as a file descriptor flag with
the 'fcntl' function.  The value is an integer constant usable as a bit
mask value.

 -- Macro: int FD_CLOEXEC

     This flag specifies that the file descriptor should be closed when
     an 'exec' function is invoked; see *note Executing a File::.  When
     a file descriptor is allocated (as with 'open' or 'dup'), this bit
     is initially cleared on the new file descriptor, meaning that
     descriptor will survive into the new program after 'exec'.

   If you want to modify the file descriptor flags, you should get the
current flags with 'F_GETFD' and modify the value.  Don't assume that
the flags listed here are the only ones that are implemented; your
program may be run years from now and more flags may exist then.  For
example, here is a function to set or clear the flag 'FD_CLOEXEC'
without altering any other flags:

     /* Set the 'FD_CLOEXEC' flag of DESC if VALUE is nonzero,
        or clear the flag if VALUE is 0.
        Return 0 on success, or -1 on error with 'errno' set. */

     int
     set_cloexec_flag (int desc, int value)
     {
       int oldflags = fcntl (desc, F_GETFD, 0);
       /* If reading the flags failed, return error indication now. */
       if (oldflags < 0)
         return oldflags;
       /* Set just the flag we want to set. */
       if (value != 0)
         oldflags |= FD_CLOEXEC;
       else
         oldflags &= ~FD_CLOEXEC;
       /* Store modified flag word in the descriptor. */
       return fcntl (desc, F_SETFD, oldflags);
     }

13.15 File Status Flags
=====------------------

"File status flags" are used to specify attributes of the opening of a
file.  Unlike the file descriptor flags discussed in *note Descriptor
Flags::, the file status flags are shared by duplicated file descriptors
resulting from a single opening of the file.  The file status flags are
specified with the FLAGS argument to 'open'; *note Opening and Closing
Files::.

   File status flags fall into three categories, which are described in
the following sections.

   * *note Access Modes::, specify what type of access is allowed to the
     file: reading, writing, or both.  They are set by 'open' and are
     returned by 'fcntl', but cannot be changed.

   * *note Open-time Flags::, control details of what 'open' will do.
     These flags are not preserved after the 'open' call.

   * *note Operating Modes::, affect how operations such as 'read' and
     'write' are done.  They are set by 'open', and can be fetched or
     changed with 'fcntl'.

   The symbols in this section are defined in the header file 'fcntl.h'.

MENU

* |Access_Modes|::                Whether the descriptor can read or write.
* |Open_time_Flags|::             Details of 'open'.
* |Operating_Modes|::             Special modes to control I/O operations.
* |Getting_File_Status_Flags|::   Fetching and changing these flags.

13.15.1 File Access Modes
-------------------------

The file access modes allow a file descriptor to be used for reading,
writing, or both.  (On GNU/Hurd systems, they can also allow none of
these, and allow execution of the file as a program.)  The access modes
are chosen when the file is opened, and never change.

 -- Macro: int O_RDONLY

     Open the file for read access.

 -- Macro: int O_WRONLY

     Open the file for write access.

 -- Macro: int O_RDWR

     Open the file for both reading and writing.

   On GNU/Hurd systems (and not on other systems), 'O_RDONLY' and
'O_WRONLY' are independent bits that can be bitwise-ORed together, and
it is valid for either bit to be set or clear.  This means that 'O_RDWR'
is the same as 'O_RDONLY|O_WRONLY'.  A file access mode of zero is
permissible; it allows no operations that do input or output to the
file, but does allow other operations such as 'fchmod'.  On GNU/Hurd
systems, since "read-only" or "write-only" is a misnomer, 'fcntl.h'
defines additional names for the file access modes.  These names are
preferred when writing GNU-specific code.  But most programs will want
to be portable to other POSIX.1 systems and should use the POSIX.1 names
above instead.

 -- Macro: int O_READ

     Open the file for reading.  Same as 'O_RDONLY'; only defined on
     GNU.

 -- Macro: int O_WRITE

     Open the file for writing.  Same as 'O_WRONLY'; only defined on
     GNU.

 -- Macro: int O_EXEC

     Open the file for executing.  Only defined on GNU.

   To determine the file access mode with 'fcntl', you must extract the
access mode bits from the retrieved file status flags.  On GNU/Hurd
systems, you can just test the 'O_READ' and 'O_WRITE' bits in the flags
word.  But in other POSIX.1 systems, reading and writing access modes
are not stored as distinct bit flags.  The portable way to extract the
file access mode bits is with 'O_ACCMODE'.

 -- Macro: int O_ACCMODE

     This macro stands for a mask that can be bitwise-ANDed with the
     file status flag value to produce a value representing the file
     access mode.  The mode will be 'O_RDONLY', 'O_WRONLY', or 'O_RDWR'.
     (On GNU/Hurd systems it could also be zero, and it never includes
     the 'O_EXEC' bit.)

13.15.2 Open-time Flags
-----------------------

The open-time flags specify options affecting how 'open' will behave.
These options are not preserved once the file is open.  The exception to
this is 'O_NONBLOCK', which is also an I/O operating mode and so it _is_
saved.  *Note Opening and Closing Files::, for how to call 'open'.

   There are two sorts of options specified by open-time flags.

   * "File name translation flags" affect how 'open' looks up the file
     name to locate the file, and whether the file can be created.

   * "Open-time action flags" specify extra operations that 'open' will
     perform on the file once it is open.

   Here are the file name translation flags.

 -- Macro: int O_CREAT

     If set, the file will be created if it doesn't already exist.

 -- Macro: int O_EXCL

     If both 'O_CREAT' and 'O_EXCL' are set, then 'open' fails if the
     specified file already exists.  This is guaranteed to never clobber
     an existing file.

     The 'O_EXCL' flag has a special meaning in combination with
     'O_TMPFILE'; see below.

 -- Macro: int O_TMPFILE

     If this flag is specified, functions in the 'open' family create an
     unnamed temporary file.  In this case, the pathname argument to the
     'open' family of functions (*note Opening and Closing Files::) is
     interpreted as the directory in which the temporary file is created
     (thus determining the file system which provides the storage for
     the file).  The 'O_TMPFILE' flag must be combined with 'O_WRONLY'
     or 'O_RDWR', and the MODE argument is required.

     The temporary file can later be given a name using 'linkat',
     turning it into a regular file.  This allows the atomic creation of
     a file with the specific file attributes (mode and extended
     attributes) and file contents.  If, for security reasons, it is not
     desirable that a name can be given to the file, the 'O_EXCL' flag
     can be specified along with 'O_TMPFILE'.

     Not all kernels support this open flag.  If this flag is
     unsupported, an attempt to create an unnamed temporary file fails
     with an error of 'EINVAL'.  If the underlying file system does not
     support the 'O_TMPFILE' flag, an 'EOPNOTSUPP' error is the result.

     The 'O_TMPFILE' flag is a GNU extension.

 -- Macro: int O_NONBLOCK

     This prevents 'open' from blocking for a "long time" to open the
     file.  This is only meaningful for some kinds of files, usually
     devices such as serial ports; when it is not meaningful, it is
     harmless and ignored.  Often, opening a port to a modem blocks
     until the modem reports carrier detection; if 'O_NONBLOCK' is
     specified, 'open' will return immediately without a carrier.

     Note that the 'O_NONBLOCK' flag is overloaded as both an I/O
     operating mode and a file name translation flag.  This means that
     specifying 'O_NONBLOCK' in 'open' also sets nonblocking I/O mode;
     *note Operating Modes::.  To open the file without blocking but do
     normal I/O that blocks, you must call 'open' with 'O_NONBLOCK' set
     and then call 'fcntl' to turn the bit off.

 -- Macro: int O_NOCTTY

     If the named file is a terminal device, don't make it the
     controlling terminal for the process.  *Note Job Control::, for
     information about what it means to be the controlling terminal.

     On GNU/Hurd systems and 4.4 BSD, opening a file never makes it the
     controlling terminal and 'O_NOCTTY' is zero.  However, GNU/Linux
     systems and some other systems use a nonzero value for 'O_NOCTTY'
     and set the controlling terminal when you open a file that is a
     terminal device; so to be portable, use 'O_NOCTTY' when it is
     important to avoid this.

   The following three file name translation flags exist only on
GNU/Hurd systems.

 -- Macro: int O_IGNORE_CTTY

     Do not recognize the named file as the controlling terminal, even
     if it refers to the process's existing controlling terminal device.
     Operations on the new file descriptor will never induce job control
     signals.  *Note Job Control::.

 -- Macro: int O_NOLINK

     If the named file is a symbolic link, open the link itself instead
     of the file it refers to.  ('fstat' on the new file descriptor will
     return the information returned by 'lstat' on the link's name.)

 -- Macro: int O_NOTRANS

     If the named file is specially translated, do not invoke the
     translator.  Open the bare file the translator itself sees.

   The open-time action flags tell 'open' to do additional operations
which are not really related to opening the file.  The reason to do them
as part of 'open' instead of in separate calls is that 'open' can do
them atomically.

 -- Macro: int O_TRUNC

     Truncate the file to zero length.  This option is only useful for
     regular files, not special files such as directories or FIFOs.
     POSIX.1 requires that you open the file for writing to use
     'O_TRUNC'.  In BSD and GNU you must have permission to write the
     file to truncate it, but you need not open for write access.

     This is the only open-time action flag specified by POSIX.1.  There
     is no good reason for truncation to be done by 'open', instead of
     by calling 'ftruncate' afterwards.  The 'O_TRUNC' flag existed in
     Unix before 'ftruncate' was invented, and is retained for backward
     compatibility.

   The remaining operating modes are BSD extensions.  They exist only on
some systems.  On other systems, these macros are not defined.

 -- Macro: int O_SHLOCK

     Acquire a shared lock on the file, as with 'flock'.  *Note File
     Locks::.

     If 'O_CREAT' is specified, the locking is done atomically when
     creating the file.  You are guaranteed that no other process will
     get the lock on the new file first.

 -- Macro: int O_EXLOCK

     Acquire an exclusive lock on the file, as with 'flock'.  *Note File
     Locks::.  This is atomic like 'O_SHLOCK'.

13.15.3 I/O Operating Modes
---------------------------

The operating modes affect how input and output operations using a file
descriptor work.  These flags are set by 'open' and can be fetched and
changed with 'fcntl'.

 -- Macro: int O_APPEND

     The bit that enables append mode for the file.  If set, then all
     'write' operations write the data at the end of the file, extending
     it, regardless of the current file position.  This is the only
     reliable way to append to a file.  In append mode, you are
     guaranteed that the data you write will always go to the current
     end of the file, regardless of other processes writing to the file.
     Conversely, if you simply set the file position to the end of file
     and write, then another process can extend the file after you set
     the file position but before you write, resulting in your data
     appearing someplace before the real end of file.

 -- Macro: int O_NONBLOCK

     The bit that enables nonblocking mode for the file.  If this bit is
     set, 'read' requests on the file can return immediately with a
     failure status if there is no input immediately available, instead
     of blocking.  Likewise, 'write' requests can also return
     immediately with a failure status if the output can't be written
     immediately.

     Note that the 'O_NONBLOCK' flag is overloaded as both an I/O
     operating mode and a file name translation flag; *note Open-time
     Flags::.

 -- Macro: int O_NDELAY

     This is an obsolete name for 'O_NONBLOCK', provided for
     compatibility with BSD. It is not defined by the POSIX.1 standard.

   The remaining operating modes are BSD and GNU extensions.  They exist
only on some systems.  On other systems, these macros are not defined.

 -- Macro: int O_ASYNC

     The bit that enables asynchronous input mode.  If set, then 'SIGIO'
     signals will be generated when input is available.  *Note Interrupt
     Input::.

     Asynchronous input mode is a BSD feature.

 -- Macro: int O_FSYNC

     The bit that enables synchronous writing for the file.  If set,
     each 'write' call will make sure the data is reliably stored on
     disk before returning.

     Synchronous writing is a BSD feature.

 -- Macro: int O_SYNC

     This is another name for 'O_FSYNC'.  They have the same value.

 -- Macro: int O_NOATIME

     If this bit is set, 'read' will not update the access time of the
     file.  *Note File Times::.  This is used by programs that do
     backups, so that backing a file up does not count as reading it.
     Only the owner of the file or the superuser may use this bit.

     This is a GNU extension.

13.15.4 Getting and Setting File Status Flags
---------------------------------------------

The 'fcntl' function can fetch or change file status flags.

 -- Macro: int F_GETFL

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to read the
     file status flags for the open file with descriptor FILEDES.

     The normal return value from 'fcntl' with this command is a
     nonnegative number which can be interpreted as the bitwise OR of
     the individual flags.  Since the file access modes are not
     single-bit values, you can mask off other bits in the returned
     flags with 'O_ACCMODE' to compare them.

     In case of an error, 'fcntl' returns -1.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this command:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is invalid.

 -- Macro: int F_SETFL

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to set the
     file status flags for the open file corresponding to the FILEDES
     argument.  This command requires a third 'int' argument to specify
     the new flags, so the call looks like this:

          fcntl (FILEDES, F_SETFL, NEW-FLAGS)

     You can't change the access mode for the file in this way; that is,
     whether the file descriptor was opened for reading or writing.

     The normal return value from 'fcntl' with this command is an
     unspecified value other than -1, which indicates an error.  The
     error conditions are the same as for the 'F_GETFL' command.

   If you want to modify the file status flags, you should get the
current flags with 'F_GETFL' and modify the value.  Don't assume that
the flags listed here are the only ones that are implemented; your
program may be run years from now and more flags may exist then.  For
example, here is a function to set or clear the flag 'O_NONBLOCK'
without altering any other flags:

     /* Set the 'O_NONBLOCK' flag of DESC if VALUE is nonzero,
        or clear the flag if VALUE is 0.
        Return 0 on success, or -1 on error with 'errno' set. */

     int
     set_nonblock_flag (int desc, int value)
     {
       int oldflags = fcntl (desc, F_GETFL, 0);
       /* If reading the flags failed, return error indication now. */
       if (oldflags == -1)
         return -1;
       /* Set just the flag we want to set. */
       if (value != 0)
         oldflags |= O_NONBLOCK;
       else
         oldflags &= ~O_NONBLOCK;
       /* Store modified flag word in the descriptor. */
       return fcntl (desc, F_SETFL, oldflags);
     }

13.16 File Locks
=====-----------

This section describes record locks that are associated with the
process.  There is also a different type of record lock that is
associated with the open file description instead of the process.  *Note
Open File Description Locks::.

   The remaining 'fcntl' commands are used to support "record locking",
which permits multiple cooperating programs to prevent each other from
simultaneously accessing parts of a file in error-prone ways.

   An "exclusive" or "write" lock gives a process exclusive access for
writing to the specified part of the file.  While a write lock is in
place, no other process can lock that part of the file.

   A "shared" or "read" lock prohibits any other process from requesting
a write lock on the specified part of the file.  However, other
processes can request read locks.

   The 'read' and 'write' functions do not actually check to see whether
there are any locks in place.  If you want to implement a locking
protocol for a file shared by multiple processes, your application must
do explicit 'fcntl' calls to request and clear locks at the appropriate
points.

   Locks are associated with processes.  A process can only have one
kind of lock set for each byte of a given file.  When any file
descriptor for that file is closed by the process, all of the locks that
process holds on that file are released, even if the locks were made
using other descriptors that remain open.  Likewise, locks are released
when a process exits, and are not inherited by child processes created
using 'fork' (*note Creating a Process::).

   When making a lock, use a 'struct flock' to specify what kind of lock
and where.  This data type and the associated macros for the 'fcntl'
function are declared in the header file 'fcntl.h'.

 -- Data Type: struct flock

     This structure is used with the 'fcntl' function to describe a file
     lock.  It has these members:

     'short int l_type'
          Specifies the type of the lock; one of 'F_RDLCK', 'F_WRLCK',
          or 'F_UNLCK'.

     'short int l_whence'
          This corresponds to the WHENCE argument to 'fseek' or 'lseek',
          and specifies what the offset is relative to.  Its value can
          be one of 'SEEK_SET', 'SEEK_CUR', or 'SEEK_END'.

     'off_t l_start'
          This specifies the offset of the start of the region to which
          the lock applies, and is given in bytes relative to the point
          specified by the 'l_whence' member.

     'off_t l_len'
          This specifies the length of the region to be locked.  A value
          of '0' is treated specially; it means the region extends to
          the end of the file.

     'pid_t l_pid'
          This field is the process ID (*note Process Creation
          Concepts::) of the process holding the lock.  It is filled in
          by calling 'fcntl' with the 'F_GETLK' command, but is ignored
          when making a lock.  If the conflicting lock is an open file
          description lock (*note Open File Description Locks::), then
          this field will be set to -1.

 -- Macro: int F_GETLK

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should get information about a lock.  This command requires
     a third argument of type 'struct flock *' to be passed to 'fcntl',
     so that the form of the call is:

          fcntl (FILEDES, F_GETLK, LOCKP)

     If there is a lock already in place that would block the lock
     described by the LOCKP argument, information about that lock
     overwrites '*LOCKP'.  Existing locks are not reported if they are
     compatible with making a new lock as specified.  Thus, you should
     specify a lock type of 'F_WRLCK' if you want to find out about both
     read and write locks, or 'F_RDLCK' if you want to find out about
     write locks only.

     There might be more than one lock affecting the region specified by
     the LOCKP argument, but 'fcntl' only returns information about one
     of them.  The 'l_whence' member of the LOCKP structure is set to
     'SEEK_SET' and the 'l_start' and 'l_len' fields set to identify the
     locked region.

     If no lock applies, the only change to the LOCKP structure is to
     update the 'l_type' to a value of 'F_UNLCK'.

     The normal return value from 'fcntl' with this command is an
     unspecified value other than -1, which is reserved to indicate an
     error.  The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     command:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is invalid.

     'EINVAL'
          Either the LOCKP argument doesn't specify valid lock
          information, or the file associated with FILEDES doesn't
          support locks.

 -- Macro: int F_SETLK

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should set or clear a lock.  This command requires a third
     argument of type 'struct flock *' to be passed to 'fcntl', so that
     the form of the call is:

          fcntl (FILEDES, F_SETLK, LOCKP)

     If the process already has a lock on any part of the region, the
     old lock on that part is replaced with the new lock.  You can
     remove a lock by specifying a lock type of 'F_UNLCK'.

     If the lock cannot be set, 'fcntl' returns immediately with a value
     of -1.  This function does not block while waiting for other
     processes to release locks.  If 'fcntl' succeeds, it returns a
     value other than -1.

     The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

     'EAGAIN'
     'EACCES'
          The lock cannot be set because it is blocked by an existing
          lock on the file.  Some systems use 'EAGAIN' in this case, and
          other systems use 'EACCES'; your program should treat them
          alike, after 'F_SETLK'.  (GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems
          always use 'EAGAIN'.)

     'EBADF'
          Either: the FILEDES argument is invalid; you requested a read
          lock but the FILEDES is not open for read access; or, you
          requested a write lock but the FILEDES is not open for write
          access.

     'EINVAL'
          Either the LOCKP argument doesn't specify valid lock
          information, or the file associated with FILEDES doesn't
          support locks.

     'ENOLCK'
          The system has run out of file lock resources; there are
          already too many file locks in place.

          Well-designed file systems never report this error, because
          they have no limitation on the number of locks.  However, you
          must still take account of the possibility of this error, as
          it could result from network access to a file system on
          another machine.

 -- Macro: int F_SETLKW

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should set or clear a lock.  It is just like the 'F_SETLK'
     command, but causes the process to block (or wait) until the
     request can be specified.

     This command requires a third argument of type 'struct flock *', as
     for the 'F_SETLK' command.

     The 'fcntl' return values and errors are the same as for the
     'F_SETLK' command, but these additional 'errno' error conditions
     are defined for this command:

     'EINTR'
          The function was interrupted by a signal while it was waiting.
          *Note Interrupted Primitives::.

     'EDEADLK'
          The specified region is being locked by another process.  But
          that process is waiting to lock a region which the current
          process has locked, so waiting for the lock would result in
          deadlock.  The system does not guarantee that it will detect
          all such conditions, but it lets you know if it notices one.

   The following macros are defined for use as values for the 'l_type'
member of the 'flock' structure.  The values are integer constants.

'F_RDLCK'

     This macro is used to specify a read (or shared) lock.

'F_WRLCK'

     This macro is used to specify a write (or exclusive) lock.

'F_UNLCK'

     This macro is used to specify that the region is unlocked.

   As an example of a situation where file locking is useful, consider a
program that can be run simultaneously by several different users, that
logs status information to a common file.  One example of such a program
might be a game that uses a file to keep track of high scores.  Another
example might be a program that records usage or accounting information
for billing purposes.

   Having multiple copies of the program simultaneously writing to the
file could cause the contents of the file to become mixed up.  But you
can prevent this kind of problem by setting a write lock on the file
before actually writing to the file.

   If the program also needs to read the file and wants to make sure
that the contents of the file are in a consistent state, then it can
also use a read lock.  While the read lock is set, no other process can
lock that part of the file for writing.

   Remember that file locks are only an _advisory_ protocol for
controlling access to a file.  There is still potential for access to
the file by programs that don't use the lock protocol.

13.17 Open File Description Locks
=====----------------------------

In contrast to process-associated record locks (*note File Locks::),
open file description record locks are associated with an open file
description rather than a process.

   Using 'fcntl' to apply an open file description lock on a region that
already has an existing open file description lock that was created via
the same file descriptor will never cause a lock conflict.

   Open file description locks are also inherited by child processes
across 'fork', or 'clone' with 'CLONE_FILES' set (*note Creating a
Process::), along with the file descriptor.

   It is important to distinguish between the open file _description_
(an instance of an open file, usually created by a call to 'open') and
an open file _descriptor_, which is a numeric value that refers to the
open file description.  The locks described here are associated with the
open file _description_ and not the open file _descriptor_.

   Using 'dup' (*note Duplicating Descriptors::) to copy a file
descriptor does not give you a new open file description, but rather
copies a reference to an existing open file description and assigns it
to a new file descriptor.  Thus, open file description locks set on a
file descriptor cloned by 'dup' will never conflict with open file
description locks set on the original descriptor since they refer to the
same open file description.  Depending on the range and type of lock
involved, the original lock may be modified by a 'F_OFD_SETLK' or
'F_OFD_SETLKW' command in this situation however.

   Open file description locks always conflict with process-associated
locks, even if acquired by the same process or on the same open file
descriptor.

   Open file description locks use the same 'struct flock' as
process-associated locks as an argument (*note File Locks::) and the
macros for the 'command' values are also declared in the header file
'fcntl.h'.  To use them, the macro '_GNU_SOURCE' must be defined prior
to including any header file.

   In contrast to process-associated locks, any 'struct flock' used as
an argument to open file description lock commands must have the 'l_pid'
value set to 0.  Also, when returning information about an open file
description lock in a 'F_GETLK' or 'F_OFD_GETLK' request, the 'l_pid'
field in 'struct flock' will be set to -1 to indicate that the lock is
not associated with a process.

   When the same 'struct flock' is reused as an argument to a
'F_OFD_SETLK' or 'F_OFD_SETLKW' request after being used for an
'F_OFD_GETLK' request, it is necessary to inspect and reset the 'l_pid'
field to 0.

 -- Macro: int F_OFD_GETLK
     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should get information about a lock.  This command requires
     a third argument of type 'struct flock *' to be passed to 'fcntl',
     so that the form of the call is:

          fcntl (FILEDES, F_OFD_GETLK, LOCKP)

     If there is a lock already in place that would block the lock
     described by the LOCKP argument, information about that lock is
     written to '*LOCKP'.  Existing locks are not reported if they are
     compatible with making a new lock as specified.  Thus, you should
     specify a lock type of 'F_WRLCK' if you want to find out about both
     read and write locks, or 'F_RDLCK' if you want to find out about
     write locks only.

     There might be more than one lock affecting the region specified by
     the LOCKP argument, but 'fcntl' only returns information about one
     of them.  Which lock is returned in this situation is undefined.

     The 'l_whence' member of the LOCKP structure are set to 'SEEK_SET'
     and the 'l_start' and 'l_len' fields are set to identify the locked
     region.

     If no conflicting lock exists, the only change to the LOCKP
     structure is to update the 'l_type' field to the value 'F_UNLCK'.

     The normal return value from 'fcntl' with this command is either 0
     on success or -1, which indicates an error.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this command:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is invalid.

     'EINVAL'
          Either the LOCKP argument doesn't specify valid lock
          information, the operating system kernel doesn't support open
          file description locks, or the file associated with FILEDES
          doesn't support locks.

 -- Macro: int F_OFD_SETLK

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should set or clear a lock.  This command requires a third
     argument of type 'struct flock *' to be passed to 'fcntl', so that
     the form of the call is:

          fcntl (FILEDES, F_OFD_SETLK, LOCKP)

     If the open file already has a lock on any part of the region, the
     old lock on that part is replaced with the new lock.  You can
     remove a lock by specifying a lock type of 'F_UNLCK'.

     If the lock cannot be set, 'fcntl' returns immediately with a value
     of -1.  This command does not wait for other tasks to release
     locks.  If 'fcntl' succeeds, it returns 0.

     The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     command:

     'EAGAIN'
          The lock cannot be set because it is blocked by an existing
          lock on the file.

     'EBADF'
          Either: the FILEDES argument is invalid; you requested a read
          lock but the FILEDES is not open for read access; or, you
          requested a write lock but the FILEDES is not open for write
          access.

     'EINVAL'
          Either the LOCKP argument doesn't specify valid lock
          information, the operating system kernel doesn't support open
          file description locks, or the file associated with FILEDES
          doesn't support locks.

     'ENOLCK'
          The system has run out of file lock resources; there are
          already too many file locks in place.

          Well-designed file systems never report this error, because
          they have no limitation on the number of locks.  However, you
          must still take account of the possibility of this error, as
          it could result from network access to a file system on
          another machine.

 -- Macro: int F_OFD_SETLKW

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should set or clear a lock.  It is just like the
     'F_OFD_SETLK' command, but causes the process to wait until the
     request can be completed.

     This command requires a third argument of type 'struct flock *', as
     for the 'F_OFD_SETLK' command.

     The 'fcntl' return values and errors are the same as for the
     'F_OFD_SETLK' command, but these additional 'errno' error
     conditions are defined for this command:

     'EINTR'
          The function was interrupted by a signal while it was waiting.
          *Note Interrupted Primitives::.

   Open file description locks are useful in the same sorts of
situations as process-associated locks.  They can also be used to
synchronize file access between threads within the same process by
having each thread perform its own 'open' of the file, to obtain its own
open file description.

   Because open file description locks are automatically freed only upon
closing the last file descriptor that refers to the open file
description, this locking mechanism avoids the possibility that locks
are inadvertently released due to a library routine opening and closing
a file without the application being aware.

   As with process-associated locks, open file description locks are
advisory.

13.18 Open File Description Locks Example
=====------------------------------------

Here is an example of using open file description locks in a threaded
program.  If this program used process-associated locks, then it would
be subject to data corruption because process-associated locks are
shared by the threads inside a process, and thus cannot be used by one
thread to lock out another thread in the same process.

   Proper error handling has been omitted in the following program for
brevity.


     #define _GNU_SOURCE
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/stat.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <fcntl.h>
     #include <pthread.h>

     #define FILENAME        "/tmp/foo"
     #define NUM_THREADS     3
     #define ITERATIONS      5

     void *
     thread_start (void *arg)
     {
       int i, fd, len;
       long tid = (long) arg;
       char buf[256];
       struct flock lck = {
         .l_whence = SEEK_SET,
         .l_start = 0,
         .l_len = 1,
       };

       fd = open ("/tmp/foo", O_RDWR | O_CREAT, 0666);

       for (i = 0; i < ITERATIONS; i++)
         {
           lck.l_type = F_WRLCK;
           fcntl (fd, F_OFD_SETLKW, &lck);

           len = sprintf (buf, "%d: tid=%ld fd=%d\n", i, tid, fd);

           lseek (fd, 0, SEEK_END);
           write (fd, buf, len);
           fsync (fd);

           lck.l_type = F_UNLCK;
           fcntl (fd, F_OFD_SETLK, &lck);

           /* sleep to ensure lock is yielded to another thread */
           usleep (1);
         }
       pthread_exit (NULL);
     }

     int
     main (int argc, char **argv)
     {
       long i;
       pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];

       truncate (FILENAME, 0);

       for (i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++)
         pthread_create (&threads[i], NULL, thread_start, (void *) i);

       pthread_exit (NULL);
       return 0;
     }

   This example creates three threads each of which loops five times,
appending to the file.  Access to the file is serialized via open file
description locks.  If we compile and run the above program, we'll end
up with /tmp/foo that has 15 lines in it.

   If we, however, were to replace the 'F_OFD_SETLK' and 'F_OFD_SETLKW'
commands with their process-associated lock equivalents, the locking
essentially becomes a noop since it is all done within the context of
the same process.  That leads to data corruption (typically manifested
as missing lines) as some threads race in and overwrite the data written
by others.

13.19 Interrupt-Driven Input
=====-----------------------

If you set the 'O_ASYNC' status flag on a file descriptor (*note File
Status Flags::), a 'SIGIO' signal is sent whenever input or output
becomes possible on that file descriptor.  The process or process group
to receive the signal can be selected by using the 'F_SETOWN' command to
the 'fcntl' function.  If the file descriptor is a socket, this also
selects the recipient of 'SIGURG' signals that are delivered when
out-of-band data arrives on that socket; see *note Out-of-Band Data::.
('SIGURG' is sent in any situation where 'select' would report the
socket as having an "exceptional condition".  *Note Waiting for I/O::.)

   If the file descriptor corresponds to a terminal device, then 'SIGIO'
signals are sent to the foreground process group of the terminal.  *Note
Job Control::.

   The symbols in this section are defined in the header file 'fcntl.h'.

 -- Macro: int F_GETOWN

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should get information about the process or process group
     to which 'SIGIO' signals are sent.  (For a terminal, this is
     actually the foreground process group ID, which you can get using
     'tcgetpgrp'; see *note Terminal Access Functions::.)

     The return value is interpreted as a process ID; if negative, its
     absolute value is the process group ID.

     The following 'errno' error condition is defined for this command:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is invalid.

 -- Macro: int F_SETOWN

     This macro is used as the COMMAND argument to 'fcntl', to specify
     that it should set the process or process group to which 'SIGIO'
     signals are sent.  This command requires a third argument of type
     'pid_t' to be passed to 'fcntl', so that the form of the call is:

          fcntl (FILEDES, F_SETOWN, PID)

     The PID argument should be a process ID. You can also pass a
     negative number whose absolute value is a process group ID.

     The return value from 'fcntl' with this command is -1 in case of
     error and some other value if successful.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this command:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is invalid.

     'ESRCH'
          There is no process or process group corresponding to PID.

13.20 Generic I/O Control operations
=====-------------------------------

GNU systems can handle most input/output operations on many different
devices and objects in terms of a few file primitives - 'read', 'write'
and 'lseek'.  However, most devices also have a few peculiar operations
which do not fit into this model.  Such as:

   * Changing the character font used on a terminal.

   * Telling a magnetic tape system to rewind or fast forward.  (Since
     they cannot move in byte increments, 'lseek' is inapplicable).

   * Ejecting a disk from a drive.

   * Playing an audio track from a CD-ROM drive.

   * Maintaining routing tables for a network.

   Although some such objects such as sockets and terminals (1) have
special functions of their own, it would not be practical to create
functions for all these cases.

   Instead these minor operations, known as "IOCTL"s, are assigned code
numbers and multiplexed through the 'ioctl' function, defined in
'sys/ioctl.h'.  The code numbers themselves are defined in many
different headers.

 -- Function: int ioctl (int FILEDES, int COMMAND, ...)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'ioctl' function performs the generic I/O operation COMMAND on
     FILEDES.

     A third argument is usually present, either a single number or a
     pointer to a structure.  The meaning of this argument, the returned
     value, and any error codes depends upon the command used.  Often -1
     is returned for a failure.

   On some systems, IOCTLs used by different devices share the same
numbers.  Thus, although use of an inappropriate IOCTL _usually_ only
produces an error, you should not attempt to use device-specific IOCTLs
on an unknown device.

   Most IOCTLs are OS-specific and/or only used in special system
utilities, and are thus beyond the scope of this document.  For an
example of the use of an IOCTL, see *note Out-of-Band Data::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Actually, the terminal-specific functions are implemented with
IOCTLs on many platforms.

14 File System Interface
*****===================

This chapter describes the GNU C Library's functions for manipulating
files.  Unlike the input and output functions (*note I/O on Streams::;
*note Low-Level I/O::), these functions are concerned with operating on
the files themselves rather than on their contents.

   Among the facilities described in this chapter are functions for
examining or modifying directories, functions for renaming and deleting
files, and functions for examining and setting file attributes such as
access permissions and modification times.

14.1 Working Directory
=====-----------------

Each process has associated with it a directory, called its "current
working directory" or simply "working directory", that is used in the
resolution of relative file names (*note File Name Resolution::).

   When you log in and begin a new session, your working directory is
initially set to the home directory associated with your login account
in the system user database.  You can find any user's home directory
using the 'getpwuid' or 'getpwnam' functions; see *note User Database::.

   Users can change the working directory using shell commands like
'cd'.  The functions described in this section are the primitives used
by those commands and by other programs for examining and changing the
working directory.

   Prototypes for these functions are declared in the header file
'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: char * getcwd (char *BUFFER, size_t SIZE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'getcwd' function returns an absolute file name representing
     the current working directory, storing it in the character array
     BUFFER that you provide.  The SIZE argument is how you tell the
     system the allocation size of BUFFER.

     The GNU C Library version of this function also permits you to
     specify a null pointer for the BUFFER argument.  Then 'getcwd'
     allocates a buffer automatically, as with 'malloc' (*note
     Unconstrained Allocation::).  If the SIZE is greater than zero,
     then the buffer is that large; otherwise, the buffer is as large as
     necessary to hold the result.

     The return value is BUFFER on success and a null pointer on
     failure.  The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

     'EINVAL'
          The SIZE argument is zero and BUFFER is not a null pointer.

     'ERANGE'
          The SIZE argument is less than the length of the working
          directory name.  You need to allocate a bigger array and try
          again.

     'EACCES'
          Permission to read or search a component of the file name was
          denied.

   You could implement the behavior of GNU's 'getcwd (NULL, 0)' using
only the standard behavior of 'getcwd':

     char *
     gnu_getcwd ()
     {
       size_t size = 100;

       while (1)
         {
           char *buffer = (char *) xmalloc (size);
           if (getcwd (buffer, size) == buffer)
             return buffer;
           free (buffer);
           if (errno != ERANGE)
             return 0;
           size *= 2;
         }
     }

*Note Malloc Examples::, for information about 'xmalloc', which is not a
library function but is a customary name used in most GNU software.

 -- Deprecated Function: char * getwd (char *BUFFER)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap i18n | AC-Unsafe mem fd |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This is similar to 'getcwd', but has no way to specify the size of
     the buffer.  The GNU C Library provides 'getwd' only for backwards
     compatibility with BSD.

     The BUFFER argument should be a pointer to an array at least
     'PATH_MAX' bytes long (*note Limits for Files::).  On GNU/Hurd
     systems there is no limit to the size of a file name, so this is
     not necessarily enough space to contain the directory name.  That
     is why this function is deprecated.

 -- Function: char * get_current_dir_name (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe env | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'get_current_dir_name' function is basically equivalent to
     'getcwd (NULL, 0)', except the value of the 'PWD' environment
     variable is first examined, and if it does in fact correspond to
     the current directory, that value is returned.  This is a subtle
     difference which is visible if the path described by the value in
     'PWD' is using one or more symbolic links, in which case the value
     returned by 'getcwd' would resolve the symbolic links and therefore
     yield a different result.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int chdir (const char *FILENAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is used to set the process's working directory to
     FILENAME.

     The normal, successful return value from 'chdir' is '0'.  A value
     of '-1' is returned to indicate an error.  The 'errno' error
     conditions defined for this function are the usual file name syntax
     errors (*note File Name Errors::), plus 'ENOTDIR' if the file
     FILENAME is not a directory.

 -- Function: int fchdir (int FILEDES)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is used to set the process's working directory to
     directory associated with the file descriptor FILEDES.

     The normal, successful return value from 'fchdir' is '0'.  A value
     of '-1' is returned to indicate an error.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EACCES'
          Read permission is denied for the directory named by
          'dirname'.

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'ENOTDIR'
          The file descriptor FILEDES is not associated with a
          directory.

     'EINTR'
          The function call was interrupt by a signal.

     'EIO'
          An I/O error occurred.

14.2 Accessing Directories
=====---------------------

The facilities described in this section let you read the contents of a
directory file.  This is useful if you want your program to list all the
files in a directory, perhaps as part of a menu.

   The 'opendir' function opens a "directory stream" whose elements are
directory entries.  Alternatively 'fdopendir' can be used which can have
advantages if the program needs to have more control over the way the
directory is opened for reading.  This allows, for instance, to pass the
'O_NOATIME' flag to 'open'.

   You use the 'readdir' function on the directory stream to retrieve
these entries, represented as 'struct dirent' objects.  The name of the
file for each entry is stored in the 'd_name' member of this structure.
There are obvious parallels here to the stream facilities for ordinary
files, described in *note I/O on Streams::.

14.2.1 Format of a Directory Entry
----------------------------------

This section describes what you find in a single directory entry, as you
might obtain it from a directory stream.  All the symbols are declared
in the header file 'dirent.h'.

 -- Data Type: struct dirent

     This is a structure type used to return information about directory
     entries.  It contains the following fields:

     'char d_name[]'
          This is the null-terminated file name component.  This is the
          only field you can count on in all POSIX systems.

     'ino_t d_fileno'
          This is the file serial number.  For BSD compatibility, you
          can also refer to this member as 'd_ino'.  On GNU/Linux and
          GNU/Hurd systems and most POSIX systems, for most files this
          the same as the 'st_ino' member that 'stat' will return for
          the file.  *Note File Attributes::.

     'unsigned char d_namlen'
          This is the length of the file name, not including the
          terminating null character.  Its type is 'unsigned char'
          because that is the integer type of the appropriate size.
          This member is a BSD extension.  The symbol
          '_DIRENT_HAVE_D_NAMLEN' is defined if this member is
          available.

     'unsigned char d_type'
          This is the type of the file, possibly unknown.  The following
          constants are defined for its value:

          'DT_UNKNOWN'
               The type is unknown.  Only some filesystems have full
               support to return the type of the file, others might
               always return this value.

          'DT_REG'
               A regular file.

          'DT_DIR'
               A directory.

          'DT_FIFO'
               A named pipe, or FIFO. *Note FIFO Special Files::.

          'DT_SOCK'
               A local-domain socket.

          'DT_CHR'
               A character device.

          'DT_BLK'
               A block device.

          'DT_LNK'
               A symbolic link.

          This member is a BSD extension.  The symbol
          '_DIRENT_HAVE_D_TYPE' is defined if this member is available.
          On systems where it is used, it corresponds to the file type
          bits in the 'st_mode' member of 'struct stat'.  If the value
          cannot be determined the member value is DT_UNKNOWN. These two
          macros convert between 'd_type' values and 'st_mode' values:

           -- Function: int IFTODT (mode_t MODE)

               Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
               Safety Concepts::.

               This returns the 'd_type' value corresponding to MODE.

           -- Function: mode_t DTTOIF (int DTYPE)

               Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
               Safety Concepts::.

               This returns the 'st_mode' value corresponding to DTYPE.

     This structure may contain additional members in the future.  Their
     availability is always announced in the compilation environment by
     a macro named '_DIRENT_HAVE_D_XXX' where XXX is replaced by the
     name of the new member.  For instance, the member 'd_reclen'
     available on some systems is announced through the macro
     '_DIRENT_HAVE_D_RECLEN'.

     When a file has multiple names, each name has its own directory
     entry.  The only way you can tell that the directory entries belong
     to a single file is that they have the same value for the
     'd_fileno' field.

     File attributes such as size, modification times etc., are part of
     the file itself, not of any particular directory entry.  *Note File
     Attributes::.

14.2.2 Opening a Directory Stream
---------------------------------

This section describes how to open a directory stream.  All the symbols
are declared in the header file 'dirent.h'.

 -- Data Type: DIR

     The 'DIR' data type represents a directory stream.

   You shouldn't ever allocate objects of the 'struct dirent' or 'DIR'
data types, since the directory access functions do that for you.
Instead, you refer to these objects using the pointers returned by the
following functions.

 -- Function: DIR * opendir (const char *DIRNAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'opendir' function opens and returns a directory stream for
     reading the directory whose file name is DIRNAME.  The stream has
     type 'DIR *'.

     If unsuccessful, 'opendir' returns a null pointer.  In addition to
     the usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the
     following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EACCES'
          Read permission is denied for the directory named by
          'dirname'.

     'EMFILE'
          The process has too many files open.

     'ENFILE'
          The entire system, or perhaps the file system which contains
          the directory, cannot support any additional open files at the
          moment.  (This problem cannot happen on GNU/Hurd systems.)

     'ENOMEM'
          Not enough memory available.

     The 'DIR' type is typically implemented using a file descriptor,
     and the 'opendir' function in terms of the 'open' function.  *Note
     Low-Level I/O::.  Directory streams and the underlying file
     descriptors are closed on 'exec' (*note Executing a File::).

   The directory which is opened for reading by 'opendir' is identified
by the name.  In some situations this is not sufficient.  Or the way
'opendir' implicitly creates a file descriptor for the directory is not
the way a program might want it.  In these cases an alternative
interface can be used.

 -- Function: DIR * fdopendir (int FD)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'fdopendir' function works just like 'opendir' but instead of
     taking a file name and opening a file descriptor for the directory
     the caller is required to provide a file descriptor.  This file
     descriptor is then used in subsequent uses of the returned
     directory stream object.

     The caller must make sure the file descriptor is associated with a
     directory and it allows reading.

     If the 'fdopendir' call returns successfully the file descriptor is
     now under the control of the system.  It can be used in the same
     way the descriptor implicitly created by 'opendir' can be used but
     the program must not close the descriptor.

     In case the function is unsuccessful it returns a null pointer and
     the file descriptor remains to be usable by the program.  The
     following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The file descriptor is not valid.

     'ENOTDIR'
          The file descriptor is not associated with a directory.

     'EINVAL'
          The descriptor does not allow reading the directory content.

     'ENOMEM'
          Not enough memory available.

   In some situations it can be desirable to get hold of the file
descriptor which is created by the 'opendir' call.  For instance, to
switch the current working directory to the directory just read the
'fchdir' function could be used.  Historically the 'DIR' type was
exposed and programs could access the fields.  This does not happen in
the GNU C Library.  Instead a separate function is provided to allow
access.

 -- Function: int dirfd (DIR *DIRSTREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The function 'dirfd' returns the file descriptor associated with
     the directory stream DIRSTREAM.  This descriptor can be used until
     the directory is closed with 'closedir'.  If the directory stream
     implementation is not using file descriptors the return value is
     '-1'.

14.2.3 Reading and Closing a Directory Stream
---------------------------------------------

This section describes how to read directory entries from a directory
stream, and how to close the stream when you are done with it.  All the
symbols are declared in the header file 'dirent.h'.

 -- Function: struct dirent * readdir (DIR *DIRSTREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function reads the next entry from the directory.  It normally
     returns a pointer to a structure containing information about the
     file.  This structure is associated with the DIRSTREAM handle and
     can be rewritten by a subsequent call.

     *Portability Note:* On some systems 'readdir' may not return
     entries for '.' and '..', even though these are always valid file
     names in any directory.  *Note File Name Resolution::.

     If there are no more entries in the directory or an error is
     detected, 'readdir' returns a null pointer.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The DIRSTREAM argument is not valid.

     To distinguish between an end-of-directory condition or an error,
     you must set 'errno' to zero before calling 'readdir'.  To avoid
     entering an infinite loop, you should stop reading from the
     directory after the first error.

     Caution: The pointer returned by 'readdir' points to a buffer
     within the 'DIR' object.  The data in that buffer will be
     overwritten by the next call to 'readdir'.  You must take care, for
     instance, to copy the 'd_name' string if you need it later.

     Because of this, it is not safe to share a 'DIR' object among
     multiple threads, unless you use your own locking to ensure that no
     thread calls 'readdir' while another thread is still using the data
     from the previous call.  In the GNU C Library, it is safe to call
     'readdir' from multiple threads as long as each thread uses its own
     'DIR' object.  POSIX.1-2008 does not require this to be safe, but
     we are not aware of any operating systems where it does not work.

     'readdir_r' allows you to provide your own buffer for the 'struct
     dirent', but it is less portable than 'readdir', and has problems
     with very long filenames (see below).  We recommend you use
     'readdir', but do not share 'DIR' objects.

 -- Function: int readdir_r (DIR *DIRSTREAM, struct dirent *ENTRY,
          struct dirent **RESULT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is a version of 'readdir' which performs internal
     locking.  Like 'readdir' it returns the next entry from the
     directory.  To prevent conflicts between simultaneously running
     threads the result is stored inside the ENTRY object.

     *Portability Note:* 'readdir_r' is deprecated.  It is recommended
     to use 'readdir' instead of 'readdir_r' for the following reasons:

        * On systems which do not define 'NAME_MAX', it may not be
          possible to use 'readdir_r' safely because the caller does not
          specify the length of the buffer for the directory entry.

        * On some systems, 'readdir_r' cannot read directory entries
          with very long names.  If such a name is encountered, the GNU
          C Library implementation of 'readdir_r' returns with an error
          code of 'ENAMETOOLONG' after the final directory entry has
          been read.  On other systems, 'readdir_r' may return
          successfully, but the 'd_name' member may not be
          NUL-terminated or may be truncated.

        * POSIX-1.2008 does not guarantee that 'readdir' is thread-safe,
          even when access to the same DIRSTREAM is serialized.  But in
          current implementations (including the GNU C Library), it is
          safe to call 'readdir' concurrently on different DIRSTREAMs,
          so there is no need to use 'readdir_r' in most multi-threaded
          programs.  In the rare case that multiple threads need to read
          from the same DIRSTREAM, it is still better to use 'readdir'
          and external synchronization.

        * It is expected that future versions of POSIX will obsolete
          'readdir_r' and mandate the level of thread safety for
          'readdir' which is provided by the GNU C Library and other
          implementations today.

     Normally 'readdir_r' returns zero and sets '*RESULT' to ENTRY.  If
     there are no more entries in the directory or an error is detected,
     'readdir_r' sets '*RESULT' to a null pointer and returns a nonzero
     error code, also stored in 'errno', as described for 'readdir'.

     It is also important to look at the definition of the 'struct
     dirent' type.  Simply passing a pointer to an object of this type
     for the second parameter of 'readdir_r' might not be enough.  Some
     systems don't define the 'd_name' element sufficiently long.  In
     this case the user has to provide additional space.  There must be
     room for at least 'NAME_MAX + 1' characters in the 'd_name' array.
     Code to call 'readdir_r' could look like this:

            union
            {
              struct dirent d;
              char b[offsetof (struct dirent, d_name) + NAME_MAX + 1];
            } u;

            if (readdir_r (dir, &u.d, &res) == 0)
              ...

   To support large filesystems on 32-bit machines there are LFS
variants of the last two functions.

 -- Function: struct dirent64 * readdir64 (DIR *DIRSTREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'readdir64' function is just like the 'readdir' function except
     that it returns a pointer to a record of type 'struct dirent64'.
     Some of the members of this data type (notably 'd_ino') might have
     a different size to allow large filesystems.

     In all other aspects this function is equivalent to 'readdir'.

 -- Function: int readdir64_r (DIR *DIRSTREAM, struct dirent64 *ENTRY,
          struct dirent64 **RESULT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The deprecated 'readdir64_r' function is equivalent to the
     'readdir_r' function except that it takes parameters of base type
     'struct dirent64' instead of 'struct dirent' in the second and
     third position.  The same precautions mentioned in the
     documentation of 'readdir_r' also apply here.

 -- Function: int closedir (DIR *DIRSTREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap lock/hurd | AC-Unsafe mem
     fd lock/hurd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function closes the directory stream DIRSTREAM.  It returns
     '0' on success and '-1' on failure.

     The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

     'EBADF'
          The DIRSTREAM argument is not valid.

14.2.4 Simple Program to List a Directory
-----------------------------------------

Here's a simple program that prints the names of the files in the
current working directory:


     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <dirent.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       DIR *dp;
       struct dirent *ep;

       dp = opendir ("./");
       if (dp != NULL)
         {
           while (ep = readdir (dp))
             puts (ep->d_name);
           (void) closedir (dp);
         }
       else
         perror ("Couldn't open the directory");

       return 0;
     }

   The order in which files appear in a directory tends to be fairly
random.  A more useful program would sort the entries (perhaps by
alphabetizing them) before printing them; see *note Scanning Directory
Content::, and *note Array Sort Function::.

14.2.5 Random Access in a Directory Stream
------------------------------------------

This section describes how to reread parts of a directory that you have
already read from an open directory stream.  All the symbols are
declared in the header file 'dirent.h'.

 -- Function: void rewinddir (DIR *DIRSTREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'rewinddir' function is used to reinitialize the directory
     stream DIRSTREAM, so that if you call 'readdir' it returns
     information about the first entry in the directory again.  This
     function also notices if files have been added or removed to the
     directory since it was opened with 'opendir'.  (Entries for these
     files might or might not be returned by 'readdir' if they were
     added or removed since you last called 'opendir' or 'rewinddir'.)

 -- Function: long int telldir (DIR *DIRSTREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap/bsd lock/bsd | AC-Unsafe
     mem/bsd lock/bsd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'telldir' function returns the file position of the directory
     stream DIRSTREAM.  You can use this value with 'seekdir' to restore
     the directory stream to that position.

 -- Function: void seekdir (DIR *DIRSTREAM, long int POS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap/bsd lock/bsd | AC-Unsafe
     mem/bsd lock/bsd | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'seekdir' function sets the file position of the directory
     stream DIRSTREAM to POS.  The value POS must be the result of a
     previous call to 'telldir' on this particular stream; closing and
     reopening the directory can invalidate values returned by
     'telldir'.

14.2.6 Scanning the Content of a Directory
------------------------------------------

A higher-level interface to the directory handling functions is the
'scandir' function.  With its help one can select a subset of the
entries in a directory, possibly sort them and get a list of names as
the result.

 -- Function: int scandir (const char *DIR, struct dirent ***NAMELIST,
          int (*SELECTOR) (const struct dirent *), int (*CMP) (const
          struct dirent **, const struct dirent **))

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'scandir' function scans the contents of the directory selected
     by DIR.  The result in *NAMELIST is an array of pointers to
     structures of type 'struct dirent' which describe all selected
     directory entries and which is allocated using 'malloc'.  Instead
     of always getting all directory entries returned, the user supplied
     function SELECTOR can be used to decide which entries are in the
     result.  Only the entries for which SELECTOR returns a non-zero
     value are selected.

     Finally the entries in *NAMELIST are sorted using the user-supplied
     function CMP.  The arguments passed to the CMP function are of type
     'struct dirent **', therefore one cannot directly use the 'strcmp'
     or 'strcoll' functions; instead see the functions 'alphasort' and
     'versionsort' below.

     The return value of the function is the number of entries placed in
     *NAMELIST.  If it is '-1' an error occurred (either the directory
     could not be opened for reading or the malloc call failed) and the
     global variable 'errno' contains more information on the error.

   As described above, the fourth argument to the 'scandir' function
must be a pointer to a sorting function.  For the convenience of the
programmer the GNU C Library contains implementations of functions which
are very helpful for this purpose.

 -- Function: int alphasort (const struct dirent **A, const struct
          dirent **B)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'alphasort' function behaves like the 'strcoll' function (*note
     String/Array Comparison::).  The difference is that the arguments
     are not string pointers but instead they are of type 'struct dirent
     **'.

     The return value of 'alphasort' is less than, equal to, or greater
     than zero depending on the order of the two entries A and B.

 -- Function: int versionsort (const struct dirent **A, const struct
          dirent **B)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     The 'versionsort' function is like 'alphasort' except that it uses
     the 'strverscmp' function internally.

   If the filesystem supports large files we cannot use the 'scandir'
anymore since the 'dirent' structure might not able to contain all the
information.  The LFS provides the new type 'struct dirent64'.  To use
this we need a new function.

 -- Function: int scandir64 (const char *DIR, struct dirent64
          ***NAMELIST, int (*SELECTOR) (const struct dirent64 *), int
          (*CMP) (const struct dirent64 **, const struct dirent64 **))

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'scandir64' function works like the 'scandir' function except
     that the directory entries it returns are described by elements of
     type 'struct dirent64'.  The function pointed to by SELECTOR is
     again used to select the desired entries, except that SELECTOR now
     must point to a function which takes a 'struct dirent64 *'
     parameter.

     Similarly the CMP function should expect its two arguments to be of
     type 'struct dirent64 **'.

   As CMP is now a function of a different type, the functions
'alphasort' and 'versionsort' cannot be supplied for that argument.
Instead we provide the two replacement functions below.

 -- Function: int alphasort64 (const struct dirent64 **A, const struct
          dirent **B)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'alphasort64' function behaves like the 'strcoll' function
     (*note String/Array Comparison::).  The difference is that the
     arguments are not string pointers but instead they are of type
     'struct dirent64 **'.

     Return value of 'alphasort64' is less than, equal to, or greater
     than zero depending on the order of the two entries A and B.

 -- Function: int versionsort64 (const struct dirent64 **A, const struct
          dirent64 **B)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     The 'versionsort64' function is like 'alphasort64', excepted that
     it uses the 'strverscmp' function internally.

   It is important not to mix the use of 'scandir' and the 64-bit
comparison functions or vice versa.  There are systems on which this
works but on others it will fail miserably.

14.2.7 Simple Program to List a Directory, Mark II
--------------------------------------------------

Here is a revised version of the directory lister found above (*note
Simple Directory Lister::).  Using the 'scandir' function we can avoid
the functions which work directly with the directory contents.  After
the call the returned entries are available for direct use.


     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <dirent.h>

     static int
     one (const struct dirent *unused)
     {
       return 1;
     }

     int
     main (void)
     {
       struct dirent **eps;
       int n;

       n = scandir ("./", &eps, one, alphasort);
       if (n >= 0)
         {
           int cnt;
           for (cnt = 0; cnt < n; ++cnt)
             puts (eps[cnt]->d_name);
         }
       else
         perror ("Couldn't open the directory");

       return 0;
     }

   Note the simple selector function in this example.  Since we want to
see all directory entries we always return '1'.

14.3 Working with Directory Trees
=====----------------------------

The functions described so far for handling the files in a directory
have allowed you to either retrieve the information bit by bit, or to
process all the files as a group (see 'scandir').  Sometimes it is
useful to process whole hierarchies of directories and their contained
files.  The X/Open specification defines two functions to do this.  The
simpler form is derived from an early definition in System V systems and
therefore this function is available on SVID-derived systems.  The
prototypes and required definitions can be found in the 'ftw.h' header.

   There are four functions in this family: 'ftw', 'nftw' and their
64-bit counterparts 'ftw64' and 'nftw64'.  These functions take as one
of their arguments a pointer to a callback function of the appropriate
type.

 -- Data Type: __ftw_func_t

          int (*) (const char *, const struct stat *, int)

     The type of callback functions given to the 'ftw' function.  The
     first parameter points to the file name, the second parameter to an
     object of type 'struct stat' which is filled in for the file named
     in the first parameter.

     The last parameter is a flag giving more information about the
     current file.  It can have the following values:

     'FTW_F'
          The item is either a normal file or a file which does not fit
          into one of the following categories.  This could be special
          files, sockets etc.
     'FTW_D'
          The item is a directory.
     'FTW_NS'
          The 'stat' call failed and so the information pointed to by
          the second parameter is invalid.
     'FTW_DNR'
          The item is a directory which cannot be read.
     'FTW_SL'
          The item is a symbolic link.  Since symbolic links are
          normally followed seeing this value in a 'ftw' callback
          function means the referenced file does not exist.  The
          situation for 'nftw' is different.

          This value is only available if the program is compiled with
          '_XOPEN_EXTENDED' defined before including the first header.
          The original SVID systems do not have symbolic links.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     type is in fact '__ftw64_func_t' since this mode changes 'struct
     stat' to be 'struct stat64'.

   For the LFS interface and for use in the function 'ftw64', the header
'ftw.h' defines another function type.

 -- Data Type: __ftw64_func_t

          int (*) (const char *, const struct stat64 *, int)

     This type is used just like '__ftw_func_t' for the callback
     function, but this time is called from 'ftw64'.  The second
     parameter to the function is a pointer to a variable of type
     'struct stat64' which is able to represent the larger values.

 -- Data Type: __nftw_func_t

          int (*) (const char *, const struct stat *, int, struct FTW *)

     The first three arguments are the same as for the '__ftw_func_t'
     type.  However for the third argument some additional values are
     defined to allow finer differentiation:
     'FTW_DP'
          The current item is a directory and all subdirectories have
          already been visited and reported.  This flag is returned
          instead of 'FTW_D' if the 'FTW_DEPTH' flag is passed to 'nftw'
          (see below).
     'FTW_SLN'
          The current item is a stale symbolic link.  The file it points
          to does not exist.

     The last parameter of the callback function is a pointer to a
     structure with some extra information as described below.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     type is in fact '__nftw64_func_t' since this mode changes 'struct
     stat' to be 'struct stat64'.

   For the LFS interface there is also a variant of this data type
available which has to be used with the 'nftw64' function.

 -- Data Type: __nftw64_func_t

          int (*) (const char *, const struct stat64 *, int, struct FTW *)

     This type is used just like '__nftw_func_t' for the callback
     function, but this time is called from 'nftw64'.  The second
     parameter to the function is this time a pointer to a variable of
     type 'struct stat64' which is able to represent the larger values.

 -- Data Type: struct FTW

     The information contained in this structure helps in interpreting
     the name parameter and gives some information about the current
     state of the traversal of the directory hierarchy.

     'int base'
          The value is the offset into the string passed in the first
          parameter to the callback function of the beginning of the
          file name.  The rest of the string is the path of the file.
          This information is especially important if the 'FTW_CHDIR'
          flag was set in calling 'nftw' since then the current
          directory is the one the current item is found in.
     'int level'
          Whilst processing, the code tracks how many directories down
          it has gone to find the current file.  This nesting level
          starts at 0 for files in the initial directory (or is zero for
          the initial file if a file was passed).

 -- Function: int ftw (const char *FILENAME, __ftw_func_t FUNC, int
          DESCRIPTORS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'ftw' function calls the callback function given in the
     parameter FUNC for every item which is found in the directory
     specified by FILENAME and all directories below.  The function
     follows symbolic links if necessary but does not process an item
     twice.  If FILENAME is not a directory then it itself is the only
     object returned to the callback function.

     The file name passed to the callback function is constructed by
     taking the FILENAME parameter and appending the names of all passed
     directories and then the local file name.  So the callback function
     can use this parameter to access the file.  'ftw' also calls 'stat'
     for the file and passes that information on to the callback
     function.  If this 'stat' call is not successful the failure is
     indicated by setting the third argument of the callback function to
     'FTW_NS'.  Otherwise it is set according to the description given
     in the account of '__ftw_func_t' above.

     The callback function is expected to return 0 to indicate that no
     error occurred and that processing should continue.  If an error
     occurred in the callback function or it wants 'ftw' to return
     immediately, the callback function can return a value other than 0.
     This is the only correct way to stop the function.  The program
     must not use 'setjmp' or similar techniques to continue from
     another place.  This would leave resources allocated by the 'ftw'
     function unfreed.

     The DESCRIPTORS parameter to 'ftw' specifies how many file
     descriptors it is allowed to consume.  The function runs faster the
     more descriptors it can use.  For each level in the directory
     hierarchy at most one descriptor is used, but for very deep ones
     any limit on open file descriptors for the process or the system
     may be exceeded.  Moreover, file descriptor limits in a
     multi-threaded program apply to all the threads as a group, and
     therefore it is a good idea to supply a reasonable limit to the
     number of open descriptors.

     The return value of the 'ftw' function is 0 if all callback
     function calls returned 0 and all actions performed by the 'ftw'
     succeeded.  If a function call failed (other than calling 'stat' on
     an item) the function returns -1.  If a callback function returns a
     value other than 0 this value is returned as the return value of
     'ftw'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is in fact 'ftw64', i.e., the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: int ftw64 (const char *FILENAME, __ftw64_func_t FUNC, int
          DESCRIPTORS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'ftw' but it can work on filesystems
     with large files.  File information is reported using a variable of
     type 'struct stat64' which is passed by reference to the callback
     function.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is available under the name 'ftw' and
     transparently replaces the old implementation.

 -- Function: int nftw (const char *FILENAME, __nftw_func_t FUNC, int
          DESCRIPTORS, int FLAG)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe cwd | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd cwd
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'nftw' function works like the 'ftw' functions.  They call the
     callback function FUNC for all items found in the directory
     FILENAME and below.  At most DESCRIPTORS file descriptors are
     consumed during the 'nftw' call.

     One difference is that the callback function is of a different
     type.  It is of type 'struct FTW *' and provides the callback
     function with the extra information described above.

     A second difference is that 'nftw' takes a fourth argument, which
     is 0 or a bitwise-OR combination of any of the following values.

     'FTW_PHYS'
          While traversing the directory symbolic links are not
          followed.  Instead symbolic links are reported using the
          'FTW_SL' value for the type parameter to the callback
          function.  If the file referenced by a symbolic link does not
          exist 'FTW_SLN' is returned instead.
     'FTW_MOUNT'
          The callback function is only called for items which are on
          the same mounted filesystem as the directory given by the
          FILENAME parameter to 'nftw'.
     'FTW_CHDIR'
          If this flag is given the current working directory is changed
          to the directory of the reported object before the callback
          function is called.  When 'ntfw' finally returns the current
          directory is restored to its original value.
     'FTW_DEPTH'
          If this option is specified then all subdirectories and files
          within them are processed before processing the top directory
          itself (depth-first processing).  This also means the type
          flag given to the callback function is 'FTW_DP' and not
          'FTW_D'.
     'FTW_ACTIONRETVAL'
          If this option is specified then return values from callbacks
          are handled differently.  If the callback returns
          'FTW_CONTINUE', walking continues normally.  'FTW_STOP' means
          walking stops and 'FTW_STOP' is returned to the caller.  If
          'FTW_SKIP_SUBTREE' is returned by the callback with 'FTW_D'
          argument, the subtree is skipped and walking continues with
          next sibling of the directory.  If 'FTW_SKIP_SIBLINGS' is
          returned by the callback, all siblings of the current entry
          are skipped and walking continues in its parent.  No other
          return values should be returned from the callbacks if this
          option is set.  This option is a GNU extension.

     The return value is computed in the same way as for 'ftw'.  'nftw'
     returns 0 if no failures occurred and all callback functions
     returned 0.  In case of internal errors, such as memory problems,
     the return value is -1 and ERRNO is set accordingly.  If the return
     value of a callback invocation was non-zero then that value is
     returned.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is in fact 'nftw64', i.e., the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: int nftw64 (const char *FILENAME, __nftw64_func_t FUNC,
          int DESCRIPTORS, int FLAG)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe cwd | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd cwd
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'nftw' but it can work on filesystems
     with large files.  File information is reported using a variable of
     type 'struct stat64' which is passed by reference to the callback
     function.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is available under the name 'nftw' and
     transparently replaces the old implementation.

14.4 Hard Links
=====----------

In POSIX systems, one file can have many names at the same time.  All of
the names are equally real, and no one of them is preferred to the
others.

   To add a name to a file, use the 'link' function.  (The new name is
also called a "hard link" to the file.)  Creating a new link to a file
does not copy the contents of the file; it simply makes a new name by
which the file can be known, in addition to the file's existing name or
names.

   One file can have names in several directories, so the organization
of the file system is not a strict hierarchy or tree.

   In most implementations, it is not possible to have hard links to the
same file in multiple file systems.  'link' reports an error if you try
to make a hard link to the file from another file system when this
cannot be done.

   The prototype for the 'link' function is declared in the header file
'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int link (const char *OLDNAME, const char *NEWNAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'link' function makes a new link to the existing file named by
     OLDNAME, under the new name NEWNAME.

     This function returns a value of '0' if it is successful and '-1'
     on failure.  In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File
     Name Errors::) for both OLDNAME and NEWNAME, the following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EACCES'
          You are not allowed to write to the directory in which the new
          link is to be written.

     'EEXIST'
          There is already a file named NEWNAME.  If you want to replace
          this link with a new link, you must remove the old link
          explicitly first.

     'EMLINK'
          There are already too many links to the file named by OLDNAME.
          (The maximum number of links to a file is 'LINK_MAX'; see
          *note Limits for Files::.)

     'ENOENT'
          The file named by OLDNAME doesn't exist.  You can't make a
          link to a file that doesn't exist.

     'ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system that would contain the new link
          is full and cannot be extended.

     'EPERM'
          On GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems and some others, you cannot
          make links to directories.  Many systems allow only privileged
          users to do so.  This error is used to report the problem.

     'EROFS'
          The directory containing the new link can't be modified
          because it's on a read-only file system.

     'EXDEV'
          The directory specified in NEWNAME is on a different file
          system than the existing file.

     'EIO'
          A hardware error occurred while trying to read or write the to
          filesystem.

 -- Function: int linkat (int oldfd, const char *OLDNAME, int newfd,
          const char *NEWNAME, int flags)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'linkat' function is analogous to the 'link' function, except
     that it identifies its source and target using a combination of a
     file descriptor (referring to a directory) and a pathname.  If a
     pathnames is not absolute, it is resolved relative to the
     corresponding file descriptor.  The special file descriptor
     'AT_FDCWD' denotes the current directory.

     The FLAGS argument is a combination of the following flags:

     'AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW'
          If the source path identified by OLDFD and OLDNAME is a
          symbolic link, 'linkat' follows the symbolic link and creates
          a link to its target.  If the flag is not set, a link for the
          symbolic link itself is created; this is not supported by all
          file systems and 'linkat' can fail in this case.

     'AT_EMPTY_PATH'
          If this flag is specified, OLDNAME can be an empty string.  In
          this case, a new link to the file denoted by the descriptor
          OLDFD is created, which may have been opened with 'O_PATH' or
          'O_TMPFILE'.  This flag is a GNU extension.

14.5 Symbolic Links
=====--------------

GNU systems support "soft links" or "symbolic links".  This is a kind of
"file" that is essentially a pointer to another file name.  Unlike hard
links, symbolic links can be made to directories or across file systems
with no restrictions.  You can also make a symbolic link to a name which
is not the name of any file.  (Opening this link will fail until a file
by that name is created.)  Likewise, if the symbolic link points to an
existing file which is later deleted, the symbolic link continues to
point to the same file name even though the name no longer names any
file.

   The reason symbolic links work the way they do is that special things
happen when you try to open the link.  The 'open' function realizes you
have specified the name of a link, reads the file name contained in the
link, and opens that file name instead.  The 'stat' function likewise
operates on the file that the symbolic link points to, instead of on the
link itself.

   By contrast, other operations such as deleting or renaming the file
operate on the link itself.  The functions 'readlink' and 'lstat' also
refrain from following symbolic links, because their purpose is to
obtain information about the link.  'link', the function that makes a
hard link, does too.  It makes a hard link to the symbolic link, which
one rarely wants.

   Some systems have, for some functions operating on files, a limit on
how many symbolic links are followed when resolving a path name.  The
limit if it exists is published in the 'sys/param.h' header file.

 -- Macro: int MAXSYMLINKS

     The macro 'MAXSYMLINKS' specifies how many symlinks some function
     will follow before returning 'ELOOP'.  Not all functions behave the
     same and this value is not the same as that returned for
     '_SC_SYMLOOP' by 'sysconf'.  In fact, the 'sysconf' result can
     indicate that there is no fixed limit although 'MAXSYMLINKS' exists
     and has a finite value.

   Prototypes for most of the functions listed in this section are in
'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int symlink (const char *OLDNAME, const char *NEWNAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'symlink' function makes a symbolic link to OLDNAME named
     NEWNAME.

     The normal return value from 'symlink' is '0'.  A return value of
     '-1' indicates an error.  In addition to the usual file name syntax
     errors (*note File Name Errors::), the following 'errno' error
     conditions are defined for this function:

     'EEXIST'
          There is already an existing file named NEWNAME.

     'EROFS'
          The file NEWNAME would exist on a read-only file system.

     'ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system cannot be extended to make the
          new link.

     'EIO'
          A hardware error occurred while reading or writing data on the
          disk.

 -- Function: ssize_t readlink (const char *FILENAME, char *BUFFER,
          size_t SIZE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'readlink' function gets the value of the symbolic link
     FILENAME.  The file name that the link points to is copied into
     BUFFER.  This file name string is _not_ null-terminated; 'readlink'
     normally returns the number of characters copied.  The SIZE
     argument specifies the maximum number of characters to copy,
     usually the allocation size of BUFFER.

     If the return value equals SIZE, you cannot tell whether or not
     there was room to return the entire name.  So make a bigger buffer
     and call 'readlink' again.  Here is an example:

          char *
          readlink_malloc (const char *filename)
          {
            int size = 100;
            char *buffer = NULL;

            while (1)
              {
                buffer = (char *) xrealloc (buffer, size);
                int nchars = readlink (filename, buffer, size);
                if (nchars < 0)
                  {
                    free (buffer);
                    return NULL;
                  }
                if (nchars < size)
                  return buffer;
                size *= 2;
              }
          }

     A value of '-1' is returned in case of error.  In addition to the
     usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the following
     'errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EINVAL'
          The named file is not a symbolic link.

     'EIO'
          A hardware error occurred while reading or writing data on the
          disk.

   In some situations it is desirable to resolve all the symbolic links
to get the real name of a file where no prefix names a symbolic link
which is followed and no filename in the path is '.' or '..'.  This is
for instance desirable if files have to be compared in which case
different names can refer to the same inode.

 -- Function: char * canonicalize_file_name (const char *NAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'canonicalize_file_name' function returns the absolute name of
     the file named by NAME which contains no '.', '..' components nor
     any repeated path separators ('/') or symlinks.  The result is
     passed back as the return value of the function in a block of
     memory allocated with 'malloc'.  If the result is not used anymore
     the memory should be freed with a call to 'free'.

     If any of the path components are missing the function returns a
     NULL pointer.  This is also what is returned if the length of the
     path reaches or exceeds 'PATH_MAX' characters.  In any case 'errno'
     is set accordingly.

     'ENAMETOOLONG'
          The resulting path is too long.  This error only occurs on
          systems which have a limit on the file name length.

     'EACCES'
          At least one of the path components is not readable.

     'ENOENT'
          The input file name is empty.

     'ENOENT'
          At least one of the path components does not exist.

     'ELOOP'
          More than 'MAXSYMLINKS' many symlinks have been followed.

     This function is a GNU extension and is declared in 'stdlib.h'.

   The Unix standard includes a similar function which differs from
'canonicalize_file_name' in that the user has to provide the buffer
where the result is placed in.

 -- Function: char * realpath (const char *restrict NAME, char *restrict
          RESOLVED)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     A call to 'realpath' where the RESOLVED parameter is 'NULL' behaves
     exactly like 'canonicalize_file_name'.  The function allocates a
     buffer for the file name and returns a pointer to it.  If RESOLVED
     is not 'NULL' it points to a buffer into which the result is
     copied.  It is the callers responsibility to allocate a buffer
     which is large enough.  On systems which define 'PATH_MAX' this
     means the buffer must be large enough for a pathname of this size.
     For systems without limitations on the pathname length the
     requirement cannot be met and programs should not call 'realpath'
     with anything but 'NULL' for the second parameter.

     One other difference is that the buffer RESOLVED (if nonzero) will
     contain the part of the path component which does not exist or is
     not readable if the function returns 'NULL' and 'errno' is set to
     'EACCES' or 'ENOENT'.

     This function is declared in 'stdlib.h'.

   The advantage of using this function is that it is more widely
available.  The drawback is that it reports failures for long paths on
systems which have no limits on the file name length.

14.6 Deleting Files
=====--------------

You can delete a file with 'unlink' or 'remove'.

   Deletion actually deletes a file name.  If this is the file's only
name, then the file is deleted as well.  If the file has other remaining
names (*note Hard Links::), it remains accessible under those names.

 -- Function: int unlink (const char *FILENAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'unlink' function deletes the file name FILENAME.  If this is a
     file's sole name, the file itself is also deleted.  (Actually, if
     any process has the file open when this happens, deletion is
     postponed until all processes have closed the file.)

     The function 'unlink' is declared in the header file 'unistd.h'.

     This function returns '0' on successful completion, and '-1' on
     error.  In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File Name
     Errors::), the following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

     'EACCES'
          Write permission is denied for the directory from which the
          file is to be removed, or the directory has the sticky bit set
          and you do not own the file.

     'EBUSY'
          This error indicates that the file is being used by the system
          in such a way that it can't be unlinked.  For example, you
