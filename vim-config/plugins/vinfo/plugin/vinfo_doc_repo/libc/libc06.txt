          might see this error if the file name specifies the root
          directory or a mount point for a file system.

     'ENOENT'
          The file name to be deleted doesn't exist.

     'EPERM'
          On some systems 'unlink' cannot be used to delete the name of
          a directory, or at least can only be used this way by a
          privileged user.  To avoid such problems, use 'rmdir' to
          delete directories.  (On GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems
          'unlink' can never delete the name of a directory.)

     'EROFS'
          The directory containing the file name to be deleted is on a
          read-only file system and can't be modified.

 -- Function: int rmdir (const char *FILENAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'rmdir' function deletes a directory.  The directory must be
     empty before it can be removed; in other words, it can only contain
     entries for '.' and '..'.

     In most other respects, 'rmdir' behaves like 'unlink'.  There are
     two additional 'errno' error conditions defined for 'rmdir':

     'ENOTEMPTY'
     'EEXIST'
          The directory to be deleted is not empty.

     These two error codes are synonymous; some systems use one, and
     some use the other.  GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems always use
     'ENOTEMPTY'.

     The prototype for this function is declared in the header file
     'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int remove (const char *FILENAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This is the ISO C function to remove a file.  It works like
     'unlink' for files and like 'rmdir' for directories.  'remove' is
     declared in 'stdio.h'.

14.7 Renaming Files
==========---------

The 'rename' function is used to change a file's name.

 -- Function: int rename (const char *OLDNAME, const char *NEWNAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'rename' function renames the file OLDNAME to NEWNAME.  The
     file formerly accessible under the name OLDNAME is afterwards
     accessible as NEWNAME instead.  (If the file had any other names
     aside from OLDNAME, it continues to have those names.)

     The directory containing the name NEWNAME must be on the same file
     system as the directory containing the name OLDNAME.

     One special case for 'rename' is when OLDNAME and NEWNAME are two
     names for the same file.  The consistent way to handle this case is
     to delete OLDNAME.  However, in this case POSIX requires that
     'rename' do nothing and report success--which is inconsistent.  We
     don't know what your operating system will do.

     If OLDNAME is not a directory, then any existing file named NEWNAME
     is removed during the renaming operation.  However, if NEWNAME is
     the name of a directory, 'rename' fails in this case.

     If OLDNAME is a directory, then either NEWNAME must not exist or it
     must name a directory that is empty.  In the latter case, the
     existing directory named NEWNAME is deleted first.  The name
     NEWNAME must not specify a subdirectory of the directory 'oldname'
     which is being renamed.

     One useful feature of 'rename' is that the meaning of NEWNAME
     changes "atomically" from any previously existing file by that name
     to its new meaning (i.e., the file that was called OLDNAME).  There
     is no instant at which NEWNAME is non-existent "in between" the old
     meaning and the new meaning.  If there is a system crash during the
     operation, it is possible for both names to still exist; but
     NEWNAME will always be intact if it exists at all.

     If 'rename' fails, it returns '-1'.  In addition to the usual file
     name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the following 'errno' error
     conditions are defined for this function:

     'EACCES'
          One of the directories containing NEWNAME or OLDNAME refuses
          write permission; or NEWNAME and OLDNAME are directories and
          write permission is refused for one of them.

     'EBUSY'
          A directory named by OLDNAME or NEWNAME is being used by the
          system in a way that prevents the renaming from working.  This
          includes directories that are mount points for filesystems,
          and directories that are the current working directories of
          processes.

     'ENOTEMPTY'
     'EEXIST'
          The directory NEWNAME isn't empty.  GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd
          systems always return 'ENOTEMPTY' for this, but some other
          systems return 'EEXIST'.

     'EINVAL'
          OLDNAME is a directory that contains NEWNAME.

     'EISDIR'
          NEWNAME is a directory but the OLDNAME isn't.

     'EMLINK'
          The parent directory of NEWNAME would have too many links
          (entries).

     'ENOENT'
          The file OLDNAME doesn't exist.

     'ENOSPC'
          The directory that would contain NEWNAME has no room for
          another entry, and there is no space left in the file system
          to expand it.

     'EROFS'
          The operation would involve writing to a directory on a
          read-only file system.

     'EXDEV'
          The two file names NEWNAME and OLDNAME are on different file
          systems.

14.8 Creating Directories
==========---------------

Directories are created with the 'mkdir' function.  (There is also a
shell command 'mkdir' which does the same thing.)

 -- Function: int mkdir (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'mkdir' function creates a new, empty directory with name
     FILENAME.

     The argument MODE specifies the file permissions for the new
     directory file.  *Note Permission Bits::, for more information
     about this.

     A return value of '0' indicates successful completion, and '-1'
     indicates failure.  In addition to the usual file name syntax
     errors (*note File Name Errors::), the following 'errno' error
     conditions are defined for this function:

     'EACCES'
          Write permission is denied for the parent directory in which
          the new directory is to be added.

     'EEXIST'
          A file named FILENAME already exists.

     'EMLINK'
          The parent directory has too many links (entries).

          Well-designed file systems never report this error, because
          they permit more links than your disk could possibly hold.
          However, you must still take account of the possibility of
          this error, as it could result from network access to a file
          system on another machine.

     'ENOSPC'
          The file system doesn't have enough room to create the new
          directory.

     'EROFS'
          The parent directory of the directory being created is on a
          read-only file system and cannot be modified.

     To use this function, your program should include the header file
     'sys/stat.h'.

14.9 File Attributes
==========----------

When you issue an 'ls -l' shell command on a file, it gives you
information about the size of the file, who owns it, when it was last
modified, etc.  These are called the "file attributes", and are
associated with the file itself and not a particular one of its names.

   This section contains information about how you can inquire about and
modify the attributes of a file.

14.9.1 The meaning of the File Attributes
-----------------------------------------

When you read the attributes of a file, they come back in a structure
called 'struct stat'.  This section describes the names of the
attributes, their data types, and what they mean.  For the functions to
read the attributes of a file, see *note Reading Attributes::.

   The header file 'sys/stat.h' declares all the symbols defined in this
section.

 -- Data Type: struct stat

     The 'stat' structure type is used to return information about the
     attributes of a file.  It contains at least the following members:

     'mode_t st_mode'
          Specifies the mode of the file.  This includes file type
          information (*note Testing File Type::) and the file
          permission bits (*note Permission Bits::).

     'ino_t st_ino'
          The file serial number, which distinguishes this file from all
          other files on the same device.

     'dev_t st_dev'
          Identifies the device containing the file.  The 'st_ino' and
          'st_dev', taken together, uniquely identify the file.  The
          'st_dev' value is not necessarily consistent across reboots or
          system crashes, however.

     'nlink_t st_nlink'
          The number of hard links to the file.  This count keeps track
          of how many directories have entries for this file.  If the
          count is ever decremented to zero, then the file itself is
          discarded as soon as no process still holds it open.  Symbolic
          links are not counted in the total.

     'uid_t st_uid'
          The user ID of the file's owner.  *Note File Owner::.

     'gid_t st_gid'
          The group ID of the file.  *Note File Owner::.

     'off_t st_size'
          This specifies the size of a regular file in bytes.  For files
          that are really devices this field isn't usually meaningful.
          For symbolic links this specifies the length of the file name
          the link refers to.

     'time_t st_atime'
          This is the last access time for the file.  *Note File
          Times::.

     'unsigned long int st_atime_usec'
          This is the fractional part of the last access time for the
          file.  *Note File Times::.

     'time_t st_mtime'
          This is the time of the last modification to the contents of
          the file.  *Note File Times::.

     'unsigned long int st_mtime_usec'
          This is the fractional part of the time of the last
          modification to the contents of the file.  *Note File Times::.

     'time_t st_ctime'
          This is the time of the last modification to the attributes of
          the file.  *Note File Times::.

     'unsigned long int st_ctime_usec'
          This is the fractional part of the time of the last
          modification to the attributes of the file.  *Note File
          Times::.

     'blkcnt_t st_blocks'
          This is the amount of disk space that the file occupies,
          measured in units of 512-byte blocks.

          The number of disk blocks is not strictly proportional to the
          size of the file, for two reasons: the file system may use
          some blocks for internal record keeping; and the file may be
          sparse--it may have "holes" which contain zeros but do not
          actually take up space on the disk.

          You can tell (approximately) whether a file is sparse by
          comparing this value with 'st_size', like this:

               (st.st_blocks * 512 < st.st_size)

          This test is not perfect because a file that is just slightly
          sparse might not be detected as sparse at all.  For practical
          applications, this is not a problem.

     'unsigned int st_blksize'
          The optimal block size for reading or writing this file, in
          bytes.  You might use this size for allocating the buffer
          space for reading or writing the file.  (This is unrelated to
          'st_blocks'.)

   The extensions for the Large File Support (LFS) require, even on
32-bit machines, types which can handle file sizes up to 2^63.
Therefore a new definition of 'struct stat' is necessary.

 -- Data Type: struct stat64

     The members of this type are the same and have the same names as
     those in 'struct stat'.  The only difference is that the members
     'st_ino', 'st_size', and 'st_blocks' have a different type to
     support larger values.

     'mode_t st_mode'
          Specifies the mode of the file.  This includes file type
          information (*note Testing File Type::) and the file
          permission bits (*note Permission Bits::).

     'ino64_t st_ino'
          The file serial number, which distinguishes this file from all
          other files on the same device.

     'dev_t st_dev'
          Identifies the device containing the file.  The 'st_ino' and
          'st_dev', taken together, uniquely identify the file.  The
          'st_dev' value is not necessarily consistent across reboots or
          system crashes, however.

     'nlink_t st_nlink'
          The number of hard links to the file.  This count keeps track
          of how many directories have entries for this file.  If the
          count is ever decremented to zero, then the file itself is
          discarded as soon as no process still holds it open.  Symbolic
          links are not counted in the total.

     'uid_t st_uid'
          The user ID of the file's owner.  *Note File Owner::.

     'gid_t st_gid'
          The group ID of the file.  *Note File Owner::.

     'off64_t st_size'
          This specifies the size of a regular file in bytes.  For files
          that are really devices this field isn't usually meaningful.
          For symbolic links this specifies the length of the file name
          the link refers to.

     'time_t st_atime'
          This is the last access time for the file.  *Note File
          Times::.

     'unsigned long int st_atime_usec'
          This is the fractional part of the last access time for the
          file.  *Note File Times::.

     'time_t st_mtime'
          This is the time of the last modification to the contents of
          the file.  *Note File Times::.

     'unsigned long int st_mtime_usec'
          This is the fractional part of the time of the last
          modification to the contents of the file.  *Note File Times::.

     'time_t st_ctime'
          This is the time of the last modification to the attributes of
          the file.  *Note File Times::.

     'unsigned long int st_ctime_usec'
          This is the fractional part of the time of the last
          modification to the attributes of the file.  *Note File
          Times::.

     'blkcnt64_t st_blocks'
          This is the amount of disk space that the file occupies,
          measured in units of 512-byte blocks.

     'unsigned int st_blksize'
          The optimal block size for reading of writing this file, in
          bytes.  You might use this size for allocating the buffer
          space for reading of writing the file.  (This is unrelated to
          'st_blocks'.)

   Some of the file attributes have special data type names which exist
specifically for those attributes.  (They are all aliases for well-known
integer types that you know and love.)  These typedef names are defined
in the header file 'sys/types.h' as well as in 'sys/stat.h'.  Here is a
list of them.

 -- Data Type: mode_t

     This is an integer data type used to represent file modes.  In the
     GNU C Library, this is an unsigned type no narrower than 'unsigned
     int'.

 -- Data Type: ino_t

     This is an unsigned integer type used to represent file serial
     numbers.  (In Unix jargon, these are sometimes called "inode
     numbers".)  In the GNU C Library, this type is no narrower than
     'unsigned int'.

     If the source is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this type
     is transparently replaced by 'ino64_t'.

 -- Data Type: ino64_t

     This is an unsigned integer type used to represent file serial
     numbers for the use in LFS. In the GNU C Library, this type is no
     narrower than 'unsigned int'.

     When compiling with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this type is
     available under the name 'ino_t'.

 -- Data Type: dev_t

     This is an arithmetic data type used to represent file device
     numbers.  In the GNU C Library, this is an integer type no narrower
     than 'int'.

 -- Data Type: nlink_t

     This is an integer type used to represent file link counts.

 -- Data Type: blkcnt_t

     This is a signed integer type used to represent block counts.  In
     the GNU C Library, this type is no narrower than 'int'.

     If the source is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this type
     is transparently replaced by 'blkcnt64_t'.

 -- Data Type: blkcnt64_t

     This is a signed integer type used to represent block counts for

14.9.2 Reading the Attributes of a File
---------------------------------------

To examine the attributes of files, use the functions 'stat', 'fstat'
and 'lstat'.  They return the attribute information in a 'struct stat'
object.  All three functions are declared in the header file
'sys/stat.h'.

 -- Function: int stat (const char *FILENAME, struct stat *BUF)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'stat' function returns information about the attributes of the
     file named by FILENAME in the structure pointed to by BUF.

     If FILENAME is the name of a symbolic link, the attributes you get
     describe the file that the link points to.  If the link points to a
     nonexistent file name, then 'stat' fails reporting a nonexistent
     file.

     The return value is '0' if the operation is successful, or '-1' on
     failure.  In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File
     Name Errors::, the following 'errno' error conditions are defined
     for this function:

     'ENOENT'
          The file named by FILENAME doesn't exist.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is in fact 'stat64' since the LFS interface transparently
     replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int stat64 (const char *FILENAME, struct stat64 *BUF)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'stat' but it is also able to work on
     files larger than 2^31 bytes on 32-bit systems.  To be able to do
     this the result is stored in a variable of type 'struct stat64' to
     which BUF must point.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is available under the name 'stat' and so transparently
     replaces the interface for small files on 32-bit machines.

 -- Function: int fstat (int FILEDES, struct stat *BUF)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'fstat' function is like 'stat', except that it takes an open
     file descriptor as an argument instead of a file name.  *Note
     Low-Level I/O::.

     Like 'stat', 'fstat' returns '0' on success and '-1' on failure.
     The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for 'fstat':

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is in fact 'fstat64' since the LFS interface transparently
     replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int fstat64 (int FILEDES, struct stat64 *BUF)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'fstat' but is able to work on large
     files on 32-bit platforms.  For large files the file descriptor
     FILEDES should be obtained by 'open64' or 'creat64'.  The BUF
     pointer points to a variable of type 'struct stat64' which is able
     to represent the larger values.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is available under the name 'fstat' and so transparently
     replaces the interface for small files on 32-bit machines.

 -- Function: int lstat (const char *FILENAME, struct stat *BUF)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'lstat' function is like 'stat', except that it does not follow
     symbolic links.  If FILENAME is the name of a symbolic link,
     'lstat' returns information about the link itself; otherwise
     'lstat' works like 'stat'.  *Note Symbolic Links::.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is in fact 'lstat64' since the LFS interface transparently
     replaces the normal implementation.

 -- Function: int lstat64 (const char *FILENAME, struct stat64 *BUF)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'lstat' but it is also able to work on
     files larger than 2^31 bytes on 32-bit systems.  To be able to do
     this the result is stored in a variable of type 'struct stat64' to
     which BUF must point.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is available under the name 'lstat' and so transparently
     replaces the interface for small files on 32-bit machines.

14.9.3 Testing the Type of a File
---------------------------------

The "file mode", stored in the 'st_mode' field of the file attributes,
contains two kinds of information: the file type code, and the access
permission bits.  This section discusses only the type code, which you
can use to tell whether the file is a directory, socket, symbolic link,
and so on.  For details about access permissions see *note Permission
Bits::.

   There are two ways you can access the file type information in a file
mode.  Firstly, for each file type there is a "predicate macro" which
examines a given file mode and returns whether it is of that type or
not.  Secondly, you can mask out the rest of the file mode to leave just
the file type code, and compare this against constants for each of the
supported file types.

   All of the symbols listed in this section are defined in the header
file 'sys/stat.h'.

   The following predicate macros test the type of a file, given the
value M which is the 'st_mode' field returned by 'stat' on that file:

 -- Macro: int S_ISDIR (mode_t M)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro returns non-zero if the file is a directory.

 -- Macro: int S_ISCHR (mode_t M)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro returns non-zero if the file is a character special file
     (a device like a terminal).

 -- Macro: int S_ISBLK (mode_t M)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro returns non-zero if the file is a block special file (a
     device like a disk).

 -- Macro: int S_ISREG (mode_t M)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro returns non-zero if the file is a regular file.

 -- Macro: int S_ISFIFO (mode_t M)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro returns non-zero if the file is a FIFO special file, or
     a pipe.  *Note Pipes and FIFOs::.

 -- Macro: int S_ISLNK (mode_t M)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro returns non-zero if the file is a symbolic link.  *Note
     Symbolic Links::.

 -- Macro: int S_ISSOCK (mode_t M)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro returns non-zero if the file is a socket.  *Note
     Sockets::.

   An alternate non-POSIX method of testing the file type is supported
for compatibility with BSD. The mode can be bitwise AND-ed with 'S_IFMT'
to extract the file type code, and compared to the appropriate constant.
For example,

     S_ISCHR (MODE)

is equivalent to:

     ((MODE & S_IFMT) == S_IFCHR)

 -- Macro: int S_IFMT

     This is a bit mask used to extract the file type code from a mode
     value.

   These are the symbolic names for the different file type codes:

'S_IFDIR'

     This is the file type constant of a directory file.

'S_IFCHR'

     This is the file type constant of a character-oriented device file.

'S_IFBLK'

     This is the file type constant of a block-oriented device file.

'S_IFREG'

     This is the file type constant of a regular file.

'S_IFLNK'

     This is the file type constant of a symbolic link.

'S_IFSOCK'

     This is the file type constant of a socket.

'S_IFIFO'

     This is the file type constant of a FIFO or pipe.

   The POSIX.1b standard introduced a few more objects which possibly
can be implemented as objects in the filesystem.  These are message
queues, semaphores, and shared memory objects.  To allow differentiating
these objects from other files the POSIX standard introduced three new
test macros.  But unlike the other macros they do not take the value of
the 'st_mode' field as the parameter.  Instead they expect a pointer to
the whole 'struct stat' structure.

 -- Macro: int S_TYPEISMQ (struct stat *S)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     If the system implements POSIX message queues as distinct objects
     and the file is a message queue object, this macro returns a
     non-zero value.  In all other cases the result is zero.

 -- Macro: int S_TYPEISSEM (struct stat *S)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     If the system implements POSIX semaphores as distinct objects and
     the file is a semaphore object, this macro returns a non-zero
     value.  In all other cases the result is zero.

 -- Macro: int S_TYPEISSHM (struct stat *S)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     If the system implements POSIX shared memory objects as distinct
     objects and the file is a shared memory object, this macro returns
     a non-zero value.  In all other cases the result is zero.

14.9.4 File Owner
-----------------

Every file has an "owner" which is one of the registered user names
defined on the system.  Each file also has a "group" which is one of the
defined groups.  The file owner can often be useful for showing you who
edited the file (especially when you edit with GNU Emacs), but its main
purpose is for access control.

   The file owner and group play a role in determining access because
the file has one set of access permission bits for the owner, another
set that applies to users who belong to the file's group, and a third
set of bits that applies to everyone else.  *Note Access Permission::,
for the details of how access is decided based on this data.

   When a file is created, its owner is set to the effective user ID of
the process that creates it (*note Process Persona::).  The file's group
ID may be set to either the effective group ID of the process, or the
group ID of the directory that contains the file, depending on the
system where the file is stored.  When you access a remote file system,
it behaves according to its own rules, not according to the system your
program is running on.  Thus, your program must be prepared to encounter
either kind of behavior no matter what kind of system you run it on.

   You can change the owner and/or group owner of an existing file using
the 'chown' function.  This is the primitive for the 'chown' and 'chgrp'
shell commands.

   The prototype for this function is declared in 'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int chown (const char *FILENAME, uid_t OWNER, gid_t GROUP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'chown' function changes the owner of the file FILENAME to
     OWNER, and its group owner to GROUP.

     Changing the owner of the file on certain systems clears the
     set-user-ID and set-group-ID permission bits.  (This is because
     those bits may not be appropriate for the new owner.)  Other file
     permission bits are not changed.

     The return value is '0' on success and '-1' on failure.  In
     addition to the usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::),
     the following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

     'EPERM'
          This process lacks permission to make the requested change.

          Only privileged users or the file's owner can change the
          file's group.  On most file systems, only privileged users can
          change the file owner; some file systems allow you to change
          the owner if you are currently the owner.  When you access a
          remote file system, the behavior you encounter is determined
          by the system that actually holds the file, not by the system
          your program is running on.

          *Note Options for Files::, for information about the
          '_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED' macro.

     'EROFS'
          The file is on a read-only file system.

 -- Function: int fchown (int FILEDES, uid_t OWNER, gid_t GROUP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This is like 'chown', except that it changes the owner of the open
     file with descriptor FILEDES.

     The return value from 'fchown' is '0' on success and '-1' on
     failure.  The following 'errno' error codes are defined for this
     function:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'EINVAL'
          The FILEDES argument corresponds to a pipe or socket, not an
          ordinary file.

     'EPERM'
          This process lacks permission to make the requested change.
          For details see 'chmod' above.

     'EROFS'
          The file resides on a read-only file system.

14.9.5 The Mode Bits for Access Permission
------------------------------------------

The "file mode", stored in the 'st_mode' field of the file attributes,
contains two kinds of information: the file type code, and the access
permission bits.  This section discusses only the access permission
bits, which control who can read or write the file.  *Note Testing File
Type::, for information about the file type code.

   All of the symbols listed in this section are defined in the header
file 'sys/stat.h'.

   These symbolic constants are defined for the file mode bits that
control access permission for the file:

'S_IRUSR'
'S_IREAD'

     Read permission bit for the owner of the file.  On many systems
     this bit is 0400.  'S_IREAD' is an obsolete synonym provided for
     BSD compatibility.

'S_IWUSR'
'S_IWRITE'

     Write permission bit for the owner of the file.  Usually 0200.
     'S_IWRITE' is an obsolete synonym provided for BSD compatibility.

'S_IXUSR'
'S_IEXEC'

     Execute (for ordinary files) or search (for directories) permission
     bit for the owner of the file.  Usually 0100.  'S_IEXEC' is an
     obsolete synonym provided for BSD compatibility.

'S_IRWXU'

     This is equivalent to '(S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IXUSR)'.

'S_IRGRP'

     Read permission bit for the group owner of the file.  Usually 040.

'S_IWGRP'

     Write permission bit for the group owner of the file.  Usually 020.

'S_IXGRP'

     Execute or search permission bit for the group owner of the file.
     Usually 010.

'S_IRWXG'

     This is equivalent to '(S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IXGRP)'.

'S_IROTH'

     Read permission bit for other users.  Usually 04.

'S_IWOTH'

     Write permission bit for other users.  Usually 02.

'S_IXOTH'

     Execute or search permission bit for other users.  Usually 01.

'S_IRWXO'

     This is equivalent to '(S_IROTH | S_IWOTH | S_IXOTH)'.

'S_ISUID'

     This is the set-user-ID on execute bit, usually 04000.  *Note How
     Change Persona::.

'S_ISGID'

     This is the set-group-ID on execute bit, usually 02000.  *Note How
     Change Persona::.

'S_ISVTX'

     This is the "sticky" bit, usually 01000.

     For a directory it gives permission to delete a file in that
     directory only if you own that file.  Ordinarily, a user can either
     delete all the files in a directory or cannot delete any of them
     (based on whether the user has write permission for the directory).
     The same restriction applies--you must have both write permission
     for the directory and own the file you want to delete.  The one
     exception is that the owner of the directory can delete any file in
     the directory, no matter who owns it (provided the owner has given
     himself write permission for the directory).  This is commonly used
     for the '/tmp' directory, where anyone may create files but not
     delete files created by other users.

     Originally the sticky bit on an executable file modified the
     swapping policies of the system.  Normally, when a program
     terminated, its pages in core were immediately freed and reused.
     If the sticky bit was set on the executable file, the system kept
     the pages in core for a while as if the program were still running.
     This was advantageous for a program likely to be run many times in
     succession.  This usage is obsolete in modern systems.  When a
     program terminates, its pages always remain in core as long as
     there is no shortage of memory in the system.  When the program is
     next run, its pages will still be in core if no shortage arose
     since the last run.

     On some modern systems where the sticky bit has no useful meaning
     for an executable file, you cannot set the bit at all for a
     non-directory.  If you try, 'chmod' fails with 'EFTYPE'; *note
     Setting Permissions::.

     Some systems (particularly SunOS) have yet another use for the
     sticky bit.  If the sticky bit is set on a file that is _not_
     executable, it means the opposite: never cache the pages of this
     file at all.  The main use of this is for the files on an NFS
     server machine which are used as the swap area of diskless client
     machines.  The idea is that the pages of the file will be cached in
     the client's memory, so it is a waste of the server's memory to
     cache them a second time.  With this usage the sticky bit also
     implies that the filesystem may fail to record the file's
     modification time onto disk reliably (the idea being that no-one
     cares for a swap file).

     This bit is only available on BSD systems (and those derived from
     them).  Therefore one has to use the '_GNU_SOURCE' feature select
     macro, or not define any feature test macros, to get the definition
     (*note Feature Test Macros::).

   The actual bit values of the symbols are listed in the table above so
you can decode file mode values when debugging your programs.  These bit
values are correct for most systems, but they are not guaranteed.

   Warning: Writing explicit numbers for file permissions is bad
practice.  Not only is it not portable, it also requires everyone who
reads your program to remember what the bits mean.  To make your program
clean use the symbolic names.

14.9.6 How Your Access to a File is Decided
-------------------------------------------

Recall that the operating system normally decides access permission for
a file based on the effective user and group IDs of the process and its
supplementary group IDs, together with the file's owner, group and
permission bits.  These concepts are discussed in detail in *note
Process Persona::.

   If the effective user ID of the process matches the owner user ID of
the file, then permissions for read, write, and execute/search are
controlled by the corresponding "user" (or "owner") bits.  Likewise, if
any of the effective group ID or supplementary group IDs of the process
matches the group owner ID of the file, then permissions are controlled
by the "group" bits.  Otherwise, permissions are controlled by the
"other" bits.

   Privileged users, like 'root', can access any file regardless of its
permission bits.  As a special case, for a file to be executable even by
a privileged user, at least one of its execute bits must be set.

==============================================================================

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               *Setting_Permissions*

14.9.7 Assigning File Permissions
---------------------------------

The primitive functions for creating files (for example, 'open' or
'mkdir') take a MODE argument, which specifies the file permissions to
give the newly created file.  This mode is modified by the process's
"file creation mask", or "umask", before it is used.

   The bits that are set in the file creation mask identify permissions
that are always to be disabled for newly created files.  For example, if
you set all the "other" access bits in the mask, then newly created
files are not accessible at all to processes in the "other" category,
even if the MODE argument passed to the create function would permit
such access.  In other words, the file creation mask is the complement
of the ordinary access permissions you want to grant.

   Programs that create files typically specify a MODE argument that
includes all the permissions that make sense for the particular file.
For an ordinary file, this is typically read and write permission for
all classes of users.  These permissions are then restricted as
specified by the individual user's own file creation mask.

   To change the permission of an existing file given its name, call
'chmod'.  This function uses the specified permission bits and ignores
the file creation mask.

   In normal use, the file creation mask is initialized by the user's
login shell (using the 'umask' shell command), and inherited by all
subprocesses.  Application programs normally don't need to worry about
the file creation mask.  It will automatically do what it is supposed to
do.

   When your program needs to create a file and bypass the umask for its
access permissions, the easiest way to do this is to use 'fchmod' after
opening the file, rather than changing the umask.  In fact, changing the
umask is usually done only by shells.  They use the 'umask' function.

   The functions in this section are declared in 'sys/stat.h'.

 -- Function: mode_t umask (mode_t MASK)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'umask' function sets the file creation mask of the current
     process to MASK, and returns the previous value of the file
     creation mask.

     Here is an example showing how to read the mask with 'umask'
     without changing it permanently:

          mode_t
          read_umask (void)
          {
            mode_t mask = umask (0);
            umask (mask);
            return mask;
          }

     However, on GNU/Hurd systems it is better to use 'getumask' if you
     just want to read the mask value, because it is reentrant.

 -- Function: mode_t getumask (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     Return the current value of the file creation mask for the current
     process.  This function is a GNU extension and is only available on
     GNU/Hurd systems.

 -- Function: int chmod (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'chmod' function sets the access permission bits for the file
     named by FILENAME to MODE.

     If FILENAME is a symbolic link, 'chmod' changes the permissions of
     the file pointed to by the link, not those of the link itself.

     This function returns '0' if successful and '-1' if not.  In
     addition to the usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::),
     the following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

     'ENOENT'
          The named file doesn't exist.

     'EPERM'
          This process does not have permission to change the access
          permissions of this file.  Only the file's owner (as judged by
          the effective user ID of the process) or a privileged user can
          change them.

     'EROFS'
          The file resides on a read-only file system.

     'EFTYPE'
          MODE has the 'S_ISVTX' bit (the "sticky bit") set, and the
          named file is not a directory.  Some systems do not allow
          setting the sticky bit on non-directory files, and some do
          (and only some of those assign a useful meaning to the bit for
          non-directory files).

          You only get 'EFTYPE' on systems where the sticky bit has no
          useful meaning for non-directory files, so it is always safe
          to just clear the bit in MODE and call 'chmod' again.  *Note
          Permission Bits::, for full details on the sticky bit.

 -- Function: int fchmod (int FILEDES, mode_t MODE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This is like 'chmod', except that it changes the permissions of the
     currently open file given by FILEDES.

     The return value from 'fchmod' is '0' on success and '-1' on
     failure.  The following 'errno' error codes are defined for this
     function:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'EINVAL'
          The FILEDES argument corresponds to a pipe or socket, or
          something else that doesn't really have access permissions.

     'EPERM'
          This process does not have permission to change the access
          permissions of this file.  Only the file's owner (as judged by
          the effective user ID of the process) or a privileged user can
          change them.

     'EROFS'
          The file resides on a read-only file system.

14.9.8 Testing Permission to Access a File
------------------------------------------

In some situations it is desirable to allow programs to access files or
devices even if this is not possible with the permissions granted to the
user.  One possible solution is to set the setuid-bit of the program
file.  If such a program is started the _effective_ user ID of the
process is changed to that of the owner of the program file.  So to
allow write access to files like '/etc/passwd', which normally can be
written only by the super-user, the modifying program will have to be
owned by 'root' and the setuid-bit must be set.

   But besides the files the program is intended to change the user
should not be allowed to access any file to which s/he would not have
access anyway.  The program therefore must explicitly check whether _the
user_ would have the necessary access to a file, before it reads or
writes the file.

   To do this, use the function 'access', which checks for access
permission based on the process's _real_ user ID rather than the
effective user ID. (The setuid feature does not alter the real user ID,
so it reflects the user who actually ran the program.)

   There is another way you could check this access, which is easy to
describe, but very hard to use.  This is to examine the file mode bits
and mimic the system's own access computation.  This method is
undesirable because many systems have additional access control
features; your program cannot portably mimic them, and you would not
want to try to keep track of the diverse features that different systems
have.  Using 'access' is simple and automatically does whatever is
appropriate for the system you are using.

   'access' is _only_ appropriate to use in setuid programs.  A
non-setuid program will always use the effective ID rather than the real
ID.

   The symbols in this section are declared in 'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int access (const char *FILENAME, int HOW)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'access' function checks to see whether the file named by
     FILENAME can be accessed in the way specified by the HOW argument.
     The HOW argument either can be the bitwise OR of the flags 'R_OK',
     'W_OK', 'X_OK', or the existence test 'F_OK'.

     This function uses the _real_ user and group IDs of the calling
     process, rather than the _effective_ IDs, to check for access
     permission.  As a result, if you use the function from a 'setuid'
     or 'setgid' program (*note How Change Persona::), it gives
     information relative to the user who actually ran the program.

     The return value is '0' if the access is permitted, and '-1'
     otherwise.  (In other words, treated as a predicate function,
     'access' returns true if the requested access is _denied_.)

     In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File Name
     Errors::), the following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

     'EACCES'
          The access specified by HOW is denied.

     'ENOENT'
          The file doesn't exist.

     'EROFS'
          Write permission was requested for a file on a read-only file
          system.

   These macros are defined in the header file 'unistd.h' for use as the
HOW argument to the 'access' function.  The values are integer
constants.

 -- Macro: int R_OK

     Flag meaning test for read permission.

 -- Macro: int W_OK

     Flag meaning test for write permission.

 -- Macro: int X_OK

     Flag meaning test for execute/search permission.

 -- Macro: int F_OK

     Flag meaning test for existence of the file.

14.9.9 File Times
-----------------

Each file has three time stamps associated with it: its access time, its
modification time, and its attribute modification time.  These
correspond to the 'st_atime', 'st_mtime', and 'st_ctime' members of the
'stat' structure; see *note File Attributes::.

   All of these times are represented in calendar time format, as
'time_t' objects.  This data type is defined in 'time.h'.  For more
information about representation and manipulation of time values, see
*note Calendar Time::.

   Reading from a file updates its access time attribute, and writing
updates its modification time.  When a file is created, all three time
stamps for that file are set to the current time.  In addition, the
attribute change time and modification time fields of the directory that
contains the new entry are updated.

   Adding a new name for a file with the 'link' function updates the
attribute change time field of the file being linked, and both the
attribute change time and modification time fields of the directory
containing the new name.  These same fields are affected if a file name
is deleted with 'unlink', 'remove' or 'rmdir'.  Renaming a file with
'rename' affects only the attribute change time and modification time
fields of the two parent directories involved, and not the times for the
file being renamed.

   Changing the attributes of a file (for example, with 'chmod') updates
its attribute change time field.

   You can also change some of the time stamps of a file explicitly
using the 'utime' function--all except the attribute change time.  You
need to include the header file 'utime.h' to use this facility.

 -- Data Type: struct utimbuf

     The 'utimbuf' structure is used with the 'utime' function to
     specify new access and modification times for a file.  It contains
     the following members:

     'time_t actime'
          This is the access time for the file.

     'time_t modtime'
          This is the modification time for the file.

 -- Function: int utime (const char *FILENAME, const struct utimbuf
          *TIMES)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is used to modify the file times associated with the
     file named FILENAME.

     If TIMES is a null pointer, then the access and modification times
     of the file are set to the current time.  Otherwise, they are set
     to the values from the 'actime' and 'modtime' members
     (respectively) of the 'utimbuf' structure pointed to by TIMES.

     The attribute modification time for the file is set to the current
     time in either case (since changing the time stamps is itself a
     modification of the file attributes).

     The 'utime' function returns '0' if successful and '-1' on failure.
     In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File Name
     Errors::), the following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

     'EACCES'
          There is a permission problem in the case where a null pointer
          was passed as the TIMES argument.  In order to update the time
          stamp on the file, you must either be the owner of the file,
          have write permission for the file, or be a privileged user.

     'ENOENT'
          The file doesn't exist.

     'EPERM'
          If the TIMES argument is not a null pointer, you must either
          be the owner of the file or be a privileged user.

     'EROFS'
          The file lives on a read-only file system.

   Each of the three time stamps has a corresponding microsecond part,
which extends its resolution.  These fields are called 'st_atime_usec',
'st_mtime_usec', and 'st_ctime_usec'; each has a value between 0 and
999,999, which indicates the time in microseconds.  They correspond to
the 'tv_usec' field of a 'timeval' structure; see *note High-Resolution
Calendar::.

   The 'utimes' function is like 'utime', but also lets you specify the
fractional part of the file times.  The prototype for this function is
in the header file 'sys/time.h'.

 -- Function: int utimes (const char *FILENAME, const struct timeval
          TVP[2])

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function sets the file access and modification times of the
     file FILENAME.  The new file access time is specified by 'TVP[0]',
     and the new modification time by 'TVP[1]'.  Similar to 'utime', if
     TVP is a null pointer then the access and modification times of the
     file are set to the current time.  This function comes from BSD.

     The return values and error conditions are the same as for the
     'utime' function.

 -- Function: int lutimes (const char *FILENAME, const struct timeval
          TVP[2])

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is like 'utimes', except that it does not follow
     symbolic links.  If FILENAME is the name of a symbolic link,
     'lutimes' sets the file access and modification times of the
     symbolic link special file itself (as seen by 'lstat'; *note
     Symbolic Links::) while 'utimes' sets the file access and
     modification times of the file the symbolic link refers to.  This
     function comes from FreeBSD, and is not available on all platforms
     (if not available, it will fail with 'ENOSYS').

     The return values and error conditions are the same as for the
     'utime' function.

 -- Function: int futimes (int FD, const struct timeval TVP[2])

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is like 'utimes', except that it takes an open file
     descriptor as an argument instead of a file name.  *Note Low-Level
     I/O::.  This function comes from FreeBSD, and is not available on
     all platforms (if not available, it will fail with 'ENOSYS').

     Like 'utimes', 'futimes' returns '0' on success and '-1' on
     failure.  The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     'futimes':

     'EACCES'
          There is a permission problem in the case where a null pointer
          was passed as the TIMES argument.  In order to update the time
          stamp on the file, you must either be the owner of the file,
          have write permission for the file, or be a privileged user.

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'EPERM'
          If the TIMES argument is not a null pointer, you must either
          be the owner of the file or be a privileged user.

     'EROFS'
          The file lives on a read-only file system.

14.9.10 File Size
-----------------

Normally file sizes are maintained automatically.  A file begins with a
size of 0 and is automatically extended when data is written past its
end.  It is also possible to empty a file completely by an 'open' or
'fopen' call.

   However, sometimes it is necessary to _reduce_ the size of a file.
This can be done with the 'truncate' and 'ftruncate' functions.  They
were introduced in BSD Unix.  'ftruncate' was later added to POSIX.1.

   Some systems allow you to extend a file (creating holes) with these
functions.  This is useful when using memory-mapped I/O (*note
Memory-mapped I/O::), where files are not automatically extended.
However, it is not portable but must be implemented if 'mmap' allows
mapping of files (i.e., '_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES' is defined).

   Using these functions on anything other than a regular file gives
_undefined_ results.  On many systems, such a call will appear to
succeed, without actually accomplishing anything.

 -- Function: int truncate (const char *FILENAME, off_t LENGTH)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'truncate' function changes the size of FILENAME to LENGTH.  If
     LENGTH is shorter than the previous length, data at the end will be
     lost.  The file must be writable by the user to perform this
     operation.

     If LENGTH is longer, holes will be added to the end.  However, some
     systems do not support this feature and will leave the file
     unchanged.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'truncate' function is in fact 'truncate64' and the type 'off_t'
     has 64 bits which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     The return value is 0 for success, or -1 for an error.  In addition
     to the usual file name errors, the following errors may occur:

     'EACCES'
          The file is a directory or not writable.

     'EINVAL'
          LENGTH is negative.

     'EFBIG'
          The operation would extend the file beyond the limits of the
          operating system.

     'EIO'
          A hardware I/O error occurred.

     'EPERM'
          The file is "append-only" or "immutable".

     'EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal.

 -- Function: int truncate64 (const char *NAME, off64_t LENGTH)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'truncate' function.  The
     difference is that the LENGTH argument is 64 bits wide even on 32
     bits machines, which allows the handling of files with sizes up to
     2^63 bytes.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bits machine this function is actually available under the
     name 'truncate' and so transparently replaces the 32 bits
     interface.

 -- Function: int ftruncate (int FD, off_t LENGTH)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This is like 'truncate', but it works on a file descriptor FD for
     an opened file instead of a file name to identify the object.  The
     file must be opened for writing to successfully carry out the
     operation.

     The POSIX standard leaves it implementation defined what happens if
     the specified new LENGTH of the file is bigger than the original
     size.  The 'ftruncate' function might simply leave the file alone
     and do nothing or it can increase the size to the desired size.  In
     this later case the extended area should be zero-filled.  So using
     'ftruncate' is no reliable way to increase the file size but if it
     is possible it is probably the fastest way.  The function also
     operates on POSIX shared memory segments if these are implemented
     by the system.

     'ftruncate' is especially useful in combination with 'mmap'.  Since
     the mapped region must have a fixed size one cannot enlarge the
     file by writing something beyond the last mapped page.  Instead one
     has to enlarge the file itself and then remap the file with the new
     size.  The example below shows how this works.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'ftruncate' function is in fact 'ftruncate64' and the type 'off_t'
     has 64 bits which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     The return value is 0 for success, or -1 for an error.  The
     following errors may occur:

     'EBADF'
          FD does not correspond to an open file.

     'EACCES'
          FD is a directory or not open for writing.

     'EINVAL'
          LENGTH is negative.

     'EFBIG'
          The operation would extend the file beyond the limits of the
          operating system.

     'EIO'
          A hardware I/O error occurred.

     'EPERM'
          The file is "append-only" or "immutable".

     'EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal.

 -- Function: int ftruncate64 (int ID, off64_t LENGTH)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is similar to the 'ftruncate' function.  The
     difference is that the LENGTH argument is 64 bits wide even on 32
     bits machines which allows the handling of files with sizes up to
     2^63 bytes.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bits machine this function is actually available under the
     name 'ftruncate' and so transparently replaces the 32 bits
     interface.

   As announced here is a little example of how to use 'ftruncate' in
combination with 'mmap':

     int fd;
     void *start;
     size_t len;

     int
     add (off_t at, void *block, size_t size)
     {
       if (at + size > len)
         {
           /* Resize the file and remap.  */
           size_t ps = sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE);
           size_t ns = (at + size + ps - 1) & ~(ps - 1);
           void *np;
           if (ftruncate (fd, ns) < 0)
             return -1;
           np = mmap (NULL, ns, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
           if (np == MAP_FAILED)
             return -1;
           start = np;
           len = ns;
         }
       memcpy ((char *) start + at, block, size);
       return 0;
     }

   The function 'add' writes a block of memory at an arbitrary position
in the file.  If the current size of the file is too small it is
extended.  Note that it is extended by a whole number of pages.  This is
a requirement of 'mmap'.  The program has to keep track of the real
size, and when it has finished a final 'ftruncate' call should set the
real size of the file.

14.9.11 Storage Allocation
--------------------------

Most file systems support allocating large files in a non-contiguous
fashion: the file is split into _fragments_ which are allocated
sequentially, but the fragments themselves can be scattered across the
disk.  File systems generally try to avoid such fragmentation because it
decreases performance, but if a file gradually increases in size, there
might be no other option than to fragment it.  In addition, many file
systems support _sparse files_ with _holes_: regions of null bytes for
which no backing storage has been allocated by the file system.  When
the holes are finally overwritten with data, fragmentation can occur as
well.

   Explicit allocation of storage for yet-unwritten parts of the file
can help the system to avoid fragmentation.  Additionally, if storage
pre-allocation fails, it is possible to report the out-of-disk error
early, often without filling up the entire disk.  However, due to
deduplication, copy-on-write semantics, and file compression, such
pre-allocation may not reliably prevent the out-of-disk-space error from
occurring later.  Checking for write errors is still required, and
writes to memory-mapped regions created with 'mmap' can still result in
'SIGBUS'.

 -- Function: int posix_fallocate (int FD, off_t OFFSET, off_t LENGTH)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     Allocate backing store for the region of LENGTH bytes starting at
     byte OFFSET in the file for the descriptor FD.  The file length is
     increased to 'LENGTH + OFFSET' if necessary.

     FD must be a regular file opened for writing, or 'EBADF' is
     returned.  If there is insufficient disk space to fulfill the
     allocation request, 'ENOSPC' is returned.

     Note: If 'fallocate' is not available (because the file system
     does not support it), 'posix_fallocate' is emulated, which has the
     following drawbacks:

        * It is very inefficient because all file system blocks in the
          requested range need to be examined (even if they have been
          allocated before) and potentially rewritten.  In contrast,
          with proper 'fallocate' support (see below), the file system
          can examine the internal file allocation data structures and
          eliminate holes directly, maybe even using unwritten extents
          (which are pre-allocated but uninitialized on disk).

        * There is a race condition if another thread or process
          modifies the underlying file in the to-be-allocated area.
          Non-null bytes could be overwritten with null bytes.

        * If FD has been opened with the 'O_WRONLY' flag, the function
          will fail with an 'errno' value of 'EBADF'.

        * If FD has been opened with the 'O_APPEND' flag, the function
          will fail with an 'errno' value of 'EBADF'.

        * If LENGTH is zero, 'ftruncate' is used to increase the file
          size as requested, without allocating file system blocks.
          There is a race condition which means that 'ftruncate' can
          accidentally truncate the file if it has been extended
          concurrently.

     On Linux, if an application does not benefit from emulation or if
     the emulation is harmful due to its inherent race conditions, the
     application can use the Linux-specific 'fallocate' function, with a
     zero flag argument.  For the 'fallocate' function, the GNU C
     Library does not perform allocation emulation if the file system
     does not support allocation.  Instead, an 'EOPNOTSUPP' is returned
     to the caller.

 -- Function: int posix_fallocate64 (int FD, off64_t OFFSET, off64_t
          LENGTH)
     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is a variant of 'posix_fallocate64' which accepts
     64-bit file offsets on all platforms.

14.10 Making Special Files
==========----------------

The 'mknod' function is the primitive for making special files, such as
files that correspond to devices.  The GNU C Library includes this
function for compatibility with BSD.

   The prototype for 'mknod' is declared in 'sys/stat.h'.

 -- Function: int mknod (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE, dev_t DEV)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'mknod' function makes a special file with name FILENAME.  The
     MODE specifies the mode of the file, and may include the various
     special file bits, such as 'S_IFCHR' (for a character special file)
     or 'S_IFBLK' (for a block special file).  *Note Testing File
     Type::.

     The DEV argument specifies which device the special file refers to.
     Its exact interpretation depends on the kind of special file being
     created.

     The return value is '0' on success and '-1' on error.  In addition
     to the usual file name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the
     following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EPERM'
          The calling process is not privileged.  Only the superuser can
          create special files.

     'ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system that would contain the new file
          is full and cannot be extended.

     'EROFS'
          The directory containing the new file can't be modified
          because it's on a read-only file system.

     'EEXIST'
          There is already a file named FILENAME.  If you want to
          replace this file, you must remove the old file explicitly
          first.

14.11 Temporary Files
==========-----------

If you need to use a temporary file in your program, you can use the
'tmpfile' function to open it.  Or you can use the 'tmpnam' (better:
'tmpnam_r') function to provide a name for a temporary file and then you
can open it in the usual way with 'fopen'.

   The 'tempnam' function is like 'tmpnam' but lets you choose what
directory temporary files will go in, and something about what their
file names will look like.  Important for multi-threaded programs is
that 'tempnam' is reentrant, while 'tmpnam' is not since it returns a
pointer to a static buffer.

   These facilities are declared in the header file 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: FILE * tmpfile (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap lock | AC-Unsafe mem fd
     lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function creates a temporary binary file for update mode, as
     if by calling 'fopen' with mode '"wb+"'.  The file is deleted
     automatically when it is closed or when the program terminates.
     (On some other ISO C systems the file may fail to be deleted if the
     program terminates abnormally).

     This function is reentrant.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32-bit system this function is in fact 'tmpfile64', i.e., the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: FILE * tmpfile64 (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap lock | AC-Unsafe mem fd
     lock | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function is similar to 'tmpfile', but the stream it returns a
     pointer to was opened using 'tmpfile64'.  Therefore this stream can
     be used for files larger than 2^31 bytes on 32-bit machines.

     Please note that the return type is still 'FILE *'.  There is no
     special 'FILE' type for the LFS interface.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name 'tmpfile'
     and so transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: char * tmpnam (char *RESULT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:tmpnam/!result | AS-Unsafe | AC-Safe
     | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function constructs and returns a valid file name that does
     not refer to any existing file.  If the RESULT argument is a null
     pointer, the return value is a pointer to an internal static
     string, which might be modified by subsequent calls and therefore
     makes this function non-reentrant.  Otherwise, the RESULT argument
     should be a pointer to an array of at least 'L_tmpnam' characters,
     and the result is written into that array.

     It is possible for 'tmpnam' to fail if you call it too many times
     without removing previously-created files.  This is because the
     limited length of the temporary file names gives room for only a
     finite number of different names.  If 'tmpnam' fails it returns a
     null pointer.

     Warning: Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using 'tmpnam', leading to a possible security hole.  The
     implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted, but
     when opening the file you should use the 'O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     'tmpfile' or 'mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 -- Function: char * tmpnam_r (char *RESULT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is nearly identical to the 'tmpnam' function, except
     that if RESULT is a null pointer it returns a null pointer.

     This guarantees reentrancy because the non-reentrant situation of
     'tmpnam' cannot happen here.

     Warning: This function has the same security problems as
     'tmpnam'.

 -- Macro: int L_tmpnam

     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that
     represents the minimum size of a string large enough to hold a file
     name generated by the 'tmpnam' function.

 -- Macro: int TMP_MAX

     The macro 'TMP_MAX' is a lower bound for how many temporary names
     you can create with 'tmpnam'.  You can rely on being able to call
     'tmpnam' at least this many times before it might fail saying you
     have made too many temporary file names.

     With the GNU C Library, you can create a very large number of
     temporary file names.  If you actually created the files, you would
     probably run out of disk space before you ran out of names.  Some
     other systems have a fixed, small limit on the number of temporary
     files.  The limit is never less than '25'.

 -- Function: char * tempnam (const char *DIR, const char *PREFIX)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe env | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function generates a unique temporary file name.  If PREFIX is
     not a null pointer, up to five characters of this string are used
     as a prefix for the file name.  The return value is a string newly
     allocated with 'malloc', so you should release its storage with
     'free' when it is no longer needed.

     Because the string is dynamically allocated this function is
     reentrant.

     The directory prefix for the temporary file name is determined by
     testing each of the following in sequence.  The directory must
     exist and be writable.

        * The environment variable 'TMPDIR', if it is defined.  For
          security reasons this only happens if the program is not SUID
          or SGID enabled.

        * The DIR argument, if it is not a null pointer.

        * The value of the 'P_tmpdir' macro.

        * The directory '/tmp'.

     This function is defined for SVID compatibility.

     Warning: Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using 'tempnam', leading to a possible security hole.
     The implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted,
     but when opening the file you should use the 'O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     'tmpfile' or 'mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 -- SVID Macro: char * P_tmpdir

     This macro is the name of the default directory for temporary
     files.

   Older Unix systems did not have the functions just described.
Instead they used 'mktemp' and 'mkstemp'.  Both of these functions work
by modifying a file name template string you pass.  The last six
characters of this string must be 'XXXXXX'.  These six 'X's are replaced
with six characters which make the whole string a unique file name.
Usually the template string is something like '/tmp/PREFIXXXXXXX', and
each program uses a unique PREFIX.

   NB: Because 'mktemp' and 'mkstemp' modify the template string, you
_must not_ pass string constants to them.  String constants are normally
in read-only storage, so your program would crash when 'mktemp' or
'mkstemp' tried to modify the string.  These functions are declared in
the header file 'stdlib.h'.

 -- Function: char * mktemp (char *TEMPLATE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'mktemp' function generates a unique file name by modifying
     TEMPLATE as described above.  If successful, it returns TEMPLATE as
     modified.  If 'mktemp' cannot find a unique file name, it makes
     TEMPLATE an empty string and returns that.  If TEMPLATE does not
     end with 'XXXXXX', 'mktemp' returns a null pointer.

     Warning: Between the time the pathname is constructed and the
     file is created another process might have created a file with the
     same name using 'mktemp', leading to a possible security hole.  The
     implementation generates names which can hardly be predicted, but
     when opening the file you should use the 'O_EXCL' flag.  Using
     'mkstemp' is a safe way to avoid this problem.

 -- Function: int mkstemp (char *TEMPLATE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'mkstemp' function generates a unique file name just as
     'mktemp' does, but it also opens the file for you with 'open'
     (*note Opening and Closing Files::).  If successful, it modifies
     TEMPLATE in place and returns a file descriptor for that file open
     for reading and writing.  If 'mkstemp' cannot create a
     uniquely-named file, it returns '-1'.  If TEMPLATE does not end
     with 'XXXXXX', 'mkstemp' returns '-1' and does not modify TEMPLATE.

     The file is opened using mode '0600'.  If the file is meant to be
     used by other users this mode must be changed explicitly.

   Unlike 'mktemp', 'mkstemp' is actually guaranteed to create a unique
file that cannot possibly clash with any other program trying to create
a temporary file.  This is because it works by calling 'open' with the
'O_EXCL' flag, which says you want to create a new file and get an error
if the file already exists.

 -- Function: char * mkdtemp (char *TEMPLATE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'mkdtemp' function creates a directory with a unique name.  If
     it succeeds, it overwrites TEMPLATE with the name of the directory,
     and returns TEMPLATE.  As with 'mktemp' and 'mkstemp', TEMPLATE
     should be a string ending with 'XXXXXX'.

     If 'mkdtemp' cannot create an uniquely named directory, it returns
     'NULL' and sets ERRNO appropriately.  If TEMPLATE does not end with
     'XXXXXX', 'mkdtemp' returns 'NULL' and does not modify TEMPLATE.
     ERRNO will be set to 'EINVAL' in this case.

     The directory is created using mode '0700'.

   The directory created by 'mkdtemp' cannot clash with temporary files
or directories created by other users.  This is because directory
creation always works like 'open' with 'O_EXCL'.  *Note Creating
Directories::.

   The 'mkdtemp' function comes from OpenBSD.

15 Pipes and FIFOs
**********========

A "pipe" is a mechanism for interprocess communication; data written to
the pipe by one process can be read by another process.  The data is
handled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.  The pipe has no name; it
is created for one use and both ends must be inherited from the single
process which created the pipe.

   A "FIFO special file" is similar to a pipe, but instead of being an
anonymous, temporary connection, a FIFO has a name or names like any
other file.  Processes open the FIFO by name in order to communicate
through it.

   A pipe or FIFO has to be open at both ends simultaneously.  If you
read from a pipe or FIFO file that doesn't have any processes writing to
it (perhaps because they have all closed the file, or exited), the read
returns end-of-file.  Writing to a pipe or FIFO that doesn't have a
reading process is treated as an error condition; it generates a
'SIGPIPE' signal, and fails with error code 'EPIPE' if the signal is
handled or blocked.

   Neither pipes nor FIFO special files allow file positioning.  Both
reading and writing operations happen sequentially; reading from the
beginning of the file and writing at the end.

15.1 Creating a Pipe
==========----------

The primitive for creating a pipe is the 'pipe' function.  This creates
both the reading and writing ends of the pipe.  It is not very useful
for a single process to use a pipe to talk to itself.  In typical use, a
process creates a pipe just before it forks one or more child processes
(*note Creating a Process::).  The pipe is then used for communication
either between the parent or child processes, or between two sibling
processes.

   The 'pipe' function is declared in the header file 'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int pipe (int FILEDES[2])

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'pipe' function creates a pipe and puts the file descriptors
     for the reading and writing ends of the pipe (respectively) into
     'FILEDES[0]' and 'FILEDES[1]'.

     An easy way to remember that the input end comes first is that file
     descriptor '0' is standard input, and file descriptor '1' is
     standard output.

     If successful, 'pipe' returns a value of '0'.  On failure, '-1' is
     returned.  The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

     'EMFILE'
          The process has too many files open.

     'ENFILE'
          There are too many open files in the entire system.  *Note
          Error Codes::, for more information about 'ENFILE'.  This
          error never occurs on GNU/Hurd systems.

   Here is an example of a simple program that creates a pipe.  This
program uses the 'fork' function (*note Creating a Process::) to create
a child process.  The parent process writes data to the pipe, which is
read by the child process.


     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     /* Read characters from the pipe and echo them to 'stdout'. */

     void
     read_from_pipe (int file)
     {
       FILE *stream;
       int c;
       stream = fdopen (file, "r");
       while ((c = fgetc (stream)) != EOF)
         putchar (c);
       fclose (stream);
     }

     /* Write some random text to the pipe. */

     void
     write_to_pipe (int file)
     {
       FILE *stream;
       stream = fdopen (file, "w");
       fprintf (stream, "hello, world!\n");
       fprintf (stream, "goodbye, world!\n");
       fclose (stream);
     }

     int
     main (void)
     {
       pid_t pid;
       int mypipe[2];

       /* Create the pipe. */
       if (pipe (mypipe))
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "Pipe failed.\n");
           return EXIT_FAILURE;
         }

       /* Create the child process. */
       pid = fork ();
       if (pid == (pid_t) 0)
         {
           /* This is the child process.
              Close other end first. */
           close (mypipe[1]);
           read_from_pipe (mypipe[0]);
           return EXIT_SUCCESS;
         }
       else if (pid < (pid_t) 0)
         {
           /* The fork failed. */
           fprintf (stderr, "Fork failed.\n");
           return EXIT_FAILURE;
         }
       else
         {
           /* This is the parent process.
              Close other end first. */
           close (mypipe[0]);
           write_to_pipe (mypipe[1]);
           return EXIT_SUCCESS;
         }
     }

15.2 Pipe to a Subprocess
==========---------------

A common use of pipes is to send data to or receive data from a program
being run as a subprocess.  One way of doing this is by using a
combination of 'pipe' (to create the pipe), 'fork' (to create the
subprocess), 'dup2' (to force the subprocess to use the pipe as its
standard input or output channel), and 'exec' (to execute the new
program).  Or, you can use 'popen' and 'pclose'.

   The advantage of using 'popen' and 'pclose' is that the interface is
much simpler and easier to use.  But it doesn't offer as much
flexibility as using the low-level functions directly.

 -- Function: FILE * popen (const char *COMMAND, const char *MODE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap corrupt | AC-Unsafe corrupt
     lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'popen' function is closely related to the 'system' function;
     see *note Running a Command::.  It executes the shell command
     COMMAND as a subprocess.  However, instead of waiting for the
     command to complete, it creates a pipe to the subprocess and
     returns a stream that corresponds to that pipe.

     If you specify a MODE argument of '"r"', you can read from the
     stream to retrieve data from the standard output channel of the
     subprocess.  The subprocess inherits its standard input channel
     from the parent process.

     Similarly, if you specify a MODE argument of '"w"', you can write
     to the stream to send data to the standard input channel of the
     subprocess.  The subprocess inherits its standard output channel
     from the parent process.

     In the event of an error 'popen' returns a null pointer.  This
     might happen if the pipe or stream cannot be created, if the
     subprocess cannot be forked, or if the program cannot be executed.

 -- Function: int pclose (FILE *STREAM)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap plugin corrupt lock |
     AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'pclose' function is used to close a stream created by 'popen'.
     It waits for the child process to terminate and returns its status
     value, as for the 'system' function.

   Here is an example showing how to use 'popen' and 'pclose' to filter
output through another program, in this case the paging program 'more'.


     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     void
     write_data (FILE * stream)
     {
       int i;
       for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
         fprintf (stream, "%d\n", i);
       if (ferror (stream))
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "Output to stream failed.\n");
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }
     }

     int
     main (void)
     {
       FILE *output;

       output = popen ("more", "w");
       if (!output)
         {
           fprintf (stderr,
                    "incorrect parameters or too many files.\n");
           return EXIT_FAILURE;
         }
       write_data (output);
       if (pclose (output) != 0)
         {
           fprintf (stderr,
                    "Could not run more or other error.\n");
         }
       return EXIT_SUCCESS;
     }

15.3 FIFO Special Files
==========-------------

A FIFO special file is similar to a pipe, except that it is created in a
different way.  Instead of being an anonymous communications channel, a
FIFO special file is entered into the file system by calling 'mkfifo'.

   Once you have created a FIFO special file in this way, any process
can open it for reading or writing, in the same way as an ordinary file.
However, it has to be open at both ends simultaneously before you can
proceed to do any input or output operations on it.  Opening a FIFO for
reading normally blocks until some other process opens the same FIFO for
writing, and vice versa.

   The 'mkfifo' function is declared in the header file 'sys/stat.h'.

 -- Function: int mkfifo (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'mkfifo' function makes a FIFO special file with name FILENAME.
     The MODE argument is used to set the file's permissions; see *note
     Setting Permissions::.

     The normal, successful return value from 'mkfifo' is '0'.  In the
     case of an error, '-1' is returned.  In addition to the usual file
     name errors (*note File Name Errors::), the following 'errno' error
     conditions are defined for this function:

     'EEXIST'
          The named file already exists.

     'ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system cannot be extended.

     'EROFS'
          The directory that would contain the file resides on a
          read-only file system.

15.4 Atomicity of Pipe I/O
==========----------------

Reading or writing pipe data is "atomic" if the size of data written is
not greater than 'PIPE_BUF'.  This means that the data transfer seems to
be an instantaneous unit, in that nothing else in the system can observe
a state in which it is partially complete.  Atomic I/O may not begin
right away (it may need to wait for buffer space or for data), but once
it does begin it finishes immediately.

   Reading or writing a larger amount of data may not be atomic; for
example, output data from other processes sharing the descriptor may be
interspersed.  Also, once 'PIPE_BUF' characters have been written,
further writes will block until some characters are read.

   *Note Limits for Files::, for information about the 'PIPE_BUF'
parameter.

*********=

This chapter describes the GNU facilities for interprocess communication
using sockets.

   A "socket" is a generalized interprocess communication channel.  Like
a pipe, a socket is represented as a file descriptor.  Unlike pipes
sockets support communication between unrelated processes, and even
between processes running on different machines that communicate over a
network.  Sockets are the primary means of communicating with other
machines; 'telnet', 'rlogin', 'ftp', 'talk' and the other familiar
network programs use sockets.

   Not all operating systems support sockets.  In the GNU C Library, the
header file 'sys/socket.h' exists regardless of the operating system,
and the socket functions always exist, but if the system does not really
support sockets these functions always fail.

   Incomplete: We do not currently document the facilities for
broadcast messages or for configuring Internet interfaces.  The
reentrant functions and some newer functions that are related to IPv6
aren't documented either so far.

16.1 Socket Concepts
==========----------

When you create a socket, you must specify the style of communication
you want to use and the type of protocol that should implement it.  The
"communication style" of a socket defines the user-level semantics of
sending and receiving data on the socket.  Choosing a communication
style specifies the answers to questions such as these:

   * *What are the units of data transmission?*  Some communication
     styles regard the data as a sequence of bytes with no larger
     structure; others group the bytes into records (which are known in
     this context as "packets").

   * *Can data be lost during normal operation?*  Some communication
     styles guarantee that all the data sent arrives in the order it was
     sent (barring system or network crashes); other styles occasionally
     lose data as a normal part of operation, and may sometimes deliver
     packets more than once or in the wrong order.

     Designing a program to use unreliable communication styles usually
     involves taking precautions to detect lost or misordered packets
     and to retransmit data as needed.

   * *Is communication entirely with one partner?*  Some communication
     styles are like a telephone call--you make a "connection" with one
     remote socket and then exchange data freely.  Other styles are like
     mailing letters--you specify a destination address for each message
     you send.

   You must also choose a "namespace" for naming the socket.  A socket
name ("address") is meaningful only in the context of a particular
namespace.  In fact, even the data type to use for a socket name may
depend on the namespace.  Namespaces are also called "domains", but we
avoid that word as it can be confused with other usage of the same term.
Each namespace has a symbolic name that starts with 'PF_'.  A
corresponding symbolic name starting with 'AF_' designates the address
format for that namespace.

   Finally you must choose the "protocol" to carry out the
communication.  The protocol determines what low-level mechanism is used
to transmit and receive data.  Each protocol is valid for a particular
namespace and communication style; a namespace is sometimes called a
"protocol family" because of this, which is why the namespace names
start with 'PF_'.

   The rules of a protocol apply to the data passing between two
programs, perhaps on different computers; most of these rules are
handled by the operating system and you need not know about them.  What
you do need to know about protocols is this:

   * In order to have communication between two sockets, they must
     specify the _same_ protocol.

   * Each protocol is meaningful with particular style/namespace
     combinations and cannot be used with inappropriate combinations.
     For example, the TCP protocol fits only the byte stream style of
     communication and the Internet namespace.

   * For each combination of style and namespace there is a "default
     protocol", which you can request by specifying 0 as the protocol
     number.  And that's what you should normally do--use the default.

   Throughout the following description at various places
variables/parameters to denote sizes are required.  And here the trouble
starts.  In the first implementations the type of these variables was
simply 'int'.  On most machines at that time an 'int' was 32 bits wide,
which created a _de facto_ standard requiring 32-bit variables.  This is
important since references to variables of this type are passed to the
kernel.

   Then the POSIX people came and unified the interface with the words
"all size values are of type 'size_t'".  On 64-bit machines 'size_t' is
64 bits wide, so pointers to variables were no longer possible.

   The Unix98 specification provides a solution by introducing a type
'socklen_t'.  This type is used in all of the cases that POSIX changed
to use 'size_t'.  The only requirement of this type is that it be an
unsigned type of at least 32 bits.  Therefore, implementations which
require that references to 32-bit variables be passed can be as happy as
implementations which use 64-bit values.

16.2 Communication Styles
==========---------------

The GNU C Library includes support for several different kinds of
sockets, each with different characteristics.  This section describes
the supported socket types.  The symbolic constants listed here are
defined in 'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Macro: int SOCK_STREAM

     The 'SOCK_STREAM' style is like a pipe (*note Pipes and FIFOs::).
     It operates over a connection with a particular remote socket and
     transmits data reliably as a stream of bytes.

     Use of this style is covered in detail in *note Connections::.

 -- Macro: int SOCK_DGRAM

     The 'SOCK_DGRAM' style is used for sending individually-addressed
     packets unreliably.  It is the diametrical opposite of
     'SOCK_STREAM'.

     Each time you write data to a socket of this kind, that data
     becomes one packet.  Since 'SOCK_DGRAM' sockets do not have
     connections, you must specify the recipient address with each
     packet.

     The only guarantee that the system makes about your requests to
     transmit data is that it will try its best to deliver each packet
     you send.  It may succeed with the sixth packet after failing with
     the fourth and fifth packets; the seventh packet may arrive before
     the sixth, and may arrive a second time after the sixth.

     The typical use for 'SOCK_DGRAM' is in situations where it is
     acceptable to simply re-send a packet if no response is seen in a
     reasonable amount of time.

     *Note Datagrams::, for detailed information about how to use
     datagram sockets.

 -- Macro: int SOCK_RAW

     This style provides access to low-level network protocols and
     interfaces.  Ordinary user programs usually have no need to use
     this style.

16.3 Socket Addresses
==========-----------

The name of a socket is normally called an "address".  The functions and
symbols for dealing with socket addresses were named inconsistently,
sometimes using the term "name" and sometimes using "address".  You can
regard these terms as synonymous where sockets are concerned.

   A socket newly created with the 'socket' function has no address.
Other processes can find it for communication only if you give it an
address.  We call this "binding" the address to the socket, and the way
to do it is with the 'bind' function.

   You need only be concerned with the address of a socket if other
processes are to find it and start communicating with it.  You can
specify an address for other sockets, but this is usually pointless; the
first time you send data from a socket, or use it to initiate a
connection, the system assigns an address automatically if you have not
specified one.

   Occasionally a client needs to specify an address because the server
discriminates based on address; for example, the rsh and rlogin
protocols look at the client's socket address and only bypass passphrase
checking if it is less than 'IPPORT_RESERVED' (*note Ports::).

   The details of socket addresses vary depending on what namespace you
are using.  *Note Local Namespace::, or *note Internet Namespace::, for
specific information.

   Regardless of the namespace, you use the same functions 'bind' and
'getsockname' to set and examine a socket's address.  These functions
use a phony data type, 'struct sockaddr *', to accept the address.  In
practice, the address lives in a structure of some other data type
appropriate to the address format you are using, but you cast its
address to 'struct sockaddr *' when you pass it to 'bind'.

16.3.1 Address Formats
----------------------

The functions 'bind' and 'getsockname' use the generic data type 'struct
sockaddr *' to represent a pointer to a socket address.  You can't use
this data type effectively to interpret an address or construct one; for
that, you must use the proper data type for the socket's namespace.

   Thus, the usual practice is to construct an address of the proper
namespace-specific type, then cast a pointer to 'struct sockaddr *' when
you call 'bind' or 'getsockname'.

   The one piece of information that you can get from the 'struct
sockaddr' data type is the "address format designator".  This tells you
which data type to use to understand the address fully.

   The symbols in this section are defined in the header file
'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Data Type: struct sockaddr

     The 'struct sockaddr' type itself has the following members:

     'short int sa_family'
          This is the code for the address format of this address.  It
          identifies the format of the data which follows.

     'char sa_data[14]'
          This is the actual socket address data, which is
          format-dependent.  Its length also depends on the format, and
          may well be more than 14.  The length 14 of 'sa_data' is
          essentially arbitrary.

   Each address format has a symbolic name which starts with 'AF_'.
Each of them corresponds to a 'PF_' symbol which designates the
corresponding namespace.  Here is a list of address format names:

'AF_LOCAL'

     This designates the address format that goes with the local
     namespace.  ('PF_LOCAL' is the name of that namespace.)  *Note
     Local Namespace Details::, for information about this address
     format.

'AF_UNIX'

     This is a synonym for 'AF_LOCAL'.  Although 'AF_LOCAL' is mandated
     by POSIX.1g, 'AF_UNIX' is portable to more systems.  'AF_UNIX' was
     the traditional name stemming from BSD, so even most POSIX systems
     support it.  It is also the name of choice in the Unix98
     specification.  (The same is true for 'PF_UNIX' vs.  'PF_LOCAL').

'AF_FILE'

     This is another synonym for 'AF_LOCAL', for compatibility.
     ('PF_FILE' is likewise a synonym for 'PF_LOCAL'.)

'AF_INET'

     This designates the address format that goes with the Internet
     namespace.  ('PF_INET' is the name of that namespace.)  *Note
     Internet Address Formats::.

'AF_INET6'

     This is similar to 'AF_INET', but refers to the IPv6 protocol.
     ('PF_INET6' is the name of the corresponding namespace.)

'AF_UNSPEC'

     This designates no particular address format.  It is used only in
     rare cases, such as to clear out the default destination address of
     a "connected" datagram socket.  *Note Sending Datagrams::.

     The corresponding namespace designator symbol 'PF_UNSPEC' exists
     for completeness, but there is no reason to use it in a program.

   'sys/socket.h' defines symbols starting with 'AF_' for many different
kinds of networks, most or all of which are not actually implemented.
We will document those that really work as we receive information about
how to use them.

16.3.2 Setting the Address of a Socket
--------------------------------------

Use the 'bind' function to assign an address to a socket.  The prototype
for 'bind' is in the header file 'sys/socket.h'.  For examples of use,
see *note Local Socket Example::, or see *note Inet Example::.

 -- Function: int bind (int SOCKET, struct sockaddr *ADDR, socklen_t
          LENGTH)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'bind' function assigns an address to the socket SOCKET.  The
     ADDR and LENGTH arguments specify the address; the detailed format
     of the address depends on the namespace.  The first part of the
     address is always the format designator, which specifies a
     namespace, and says that the address is in the format of that
     namespace.

     The return value is '0' on success and '-1' on failure.  The
     following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The SOCKET argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'ENOTSOCK'
          The descriptor SOCKET is not a socket.

     'EADDRNOTAVAIL'
          The specified address is not available on this machine.

     'EADDRINUSE'
          Some other socket is already using the specified address.

     'EINVAL'
          The socket SOCKET already has an address.

     'EACCES'
          You do not have permission to access the requested address.
          (In the Internet domain, only the super-user is allowed to
          specify a port number in the range 0 through 'IPPORT_RESERVED'
          minus one; see *note Ports::.)

     Additional conditions may be possible depending on the particular
     namespace of the socket.

16.3.3 Reading the Address of a Socket
--------------------------------------

Use the function 'getsockname' to examine the address of an Internet
socket.  The prototype for this function is in the header file
'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Function: int getsockname (int SOCKET, struct sockaddr *ADDR,
          socklen_t *LENGTH-PTR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe mem/hurd | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     The 'getsockname' function returns information about the address of
     the socket SOCKET in the locations specified by the ADDR and
     LENGTH-PTR arguments.  Note that the LENGTH-PTR is a pointer; you
     should initialize it to be the allocation size of ADDR, and on
     return it contains the actual size of the address data.

     The format of the address data depends on the socket namespace.
     The length of the information is usually fixed for a given
     namespace, so normally you can know exactly how much space is
     needed and can provide that much.  The usual practice is to
     allocate a place for the value using the proper data type for the
     socket's namespace, then cast its address to 'struct sockaddr *' to
     pass it to 'getsockname'.

     The return value is '0' on success and '-1' on error.  The
     following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The SOCKET argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'ENOTSOCK'
          The descriptor SOCKET is not a socket.

     'ENOBUFS'
          There are not enough internal buffers available for the
          operation.

   You can't read the address of a socket in the file namespace.  This
is consistent with the rest of the system; in general, there's no way to
find a file's name from a descriptor for that file.

16.4 Interface Naming
==========-----------

Each network interface has a name.  This usually consists of a few
letters that relate to the type of interface, which may be followed by a
number if there is more than one interface of that type.  Examples might
be 'lo' (the loopback interface) and 'eth0' (the first Ethernet
interface).

   Although such names are convenient for humans, it would be clumsy to
have to use them whenever a program needs to refer to an interface.  In
such situations an interface is referred to by its "index", which is an
arbitrarily-assigned small positive integer.

   The following functions, constants and data types are declared in the
header file 'net/if.h'.

 -- Constant: size_t IFNAMSIZ

     This constant defines the maximum buffer size needed to hold an
     interface name, including its terminating zero byte.

 -- Function: unsigned int if_nametoindex (const char *IFNAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function yields the interface index corresponding to a
     particular name.  If no interface exists with the name given, it
     returns 0.

 -- Function: char * if_indextoname (unsigned int IFINDEX, char *IFNAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe lock | AC-Unsafe lock fd | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function maps an interface index to its corresponding name.
     The returned name is placed in the buffer pointed to by 'ifname',
     which must be at least 'IFNAMSIZ' bytes in length.  If the index
     was invalid, the function's return value is a null pointer,
     otherwise it is 'ifname'.

 -- Data Type: struct if_nameindex

     This data type is used to hold the information about a single
     interface.  It has the following members:

     'unsigned int if_index;'
          This is the interface index.

     'char *if_name'
          This is the null-terminated index name.

 -- Function: struct if_nameindex * if_nameindex (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap lock/hurd | AC-Unsafe
     lock/hurd fd mem | *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns an array of 'if_nameindex' structures, one
     for every interface that is present.  The end of the list is
     indicated by a structure with an interface of 0 and a null name
     pointer.  If an error occurs, this function returns a null pointer.

     The returned structure must be freed with 'if_freenameindex' after
     use.

 -- Function: void if_freenameindex (struct if_nameindex *PTR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Unsafe heap | AC-Unsafe mem | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function frees the structure returned by an earlier call to
     'if_nameindex'.

16.5 The Local Namespace
==========--------------

This section describes the details of the local namespace, whose
symbolic name (required when you create a socket) is 'PF_LOCAL'.  The
local namespace is also known as "Unix domain sockets".  Another name is
file namespace since socket addresses are normally implemented as file
names.

16.5.1 Local Namespace Concepts
-------------------------------

In the local namespace socket addresses are file names.  You can specify
any file name you want as the address of the socket, but you must have
write permission on the directory containing it.  It's common to put
these files in the '/tmp' directory.

   One peculiarity of the local namespace is that the name is only used
when opening the connection; once open the address is not meaningful and
may not exist.

   Another peculiarity is that you cannot connect to such a socket from
another machine-not even if the other machine shares the file system
which contains the name of the socket.  You can see the socket in a
directory listing, but connecting to it never succeeds.  Some programs
take advantage of this, such as by asking the client to send its own
process ID, and using the process IDs to distinguish between clients.
However, we recommend you not use this method in protocols you design,
as we might someday permit connections from other machines that mount
the same file systems.  Instead, send each new client an identifying
number if you want it to have one.

   After you close a socket in the local namespace, you should delete
the file name from the file system.  Use 'unlink' or 'remove' to do
this; see *note Deleting Files::.

   The local namespace supports just one protocol for any communication
style; it is protocol number '0'.

16.5.2 Details of Local Namespace
---------------------------------

To create a socket in the local namespace, use the constant 'PF_LOCAL'
as the NAMESPACE argument to 'socket' or 'socketpair'.  This constant is
defined in 'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Macro: int PF_LOCAL

     This designates the local namespace, in which socket addresses are
     local names, and its associated family of protocols.  'PF_LOCAL' is
     the macro used by POSIX.1g.

 -- Macro: int PF_UNIX

     This is a synonym for 'PF_LOCAL', for compatibility's sake.

 -- Macro: int PF_FILE

     This is a synonym for 'PF_LOCAL', for compatibility's sake.

   The structure for specifying socket names in the local namespace is
defined in the header file 'sys/un.h':

 -- Data Type: struct sockaddr_un

     This structure is used to specify local namespace socket addresses.
     It has the following members:

     'short int sun_family'
          This identifies the address family or format of the socket
          address.  You should store the value 'AF_LOCAL' to designate
          the local namespace.  *Note Socket Addresses::.

     'char sun_path[108]'
          This is the file name to use.

          Incomplete: Why is 108 a magic number?  RMS suggests making
          this a zero-length array and tweaking the following example to
          use 'alloca' to allocate an appropriate amount of storage
          based on the length of the filename.

   You should compute the LENGTH parameter for a socket address in the
local namespace as the sum of the size of the 'sun_family' component and
the string length (_not_ the allocation size!)  of the file name string.
This can be done using the macro 'SUN_LEN':

 -- Macro: int SUN_LEN (_struct sockaddr_un *_ PTR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This macro computes the length of the socket address in the local
     namespace.

         {
           perror ("socket");
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

16.6 The Internet Namespace
==========-----------------

This section describes the details of the protocols and socket naming
conventions used in the Internet namespace.

   Originally the Internet namespace used only IP version 4 (IPv4).
With the growing number of hosts on the Internet, a new protocol with a
larger address space was necessary: IP version 6 (IPv6).  IPv6
introduces 128-bit addresses (IPv4 has 32-bit addresses) and other
features, and will eventually replace IPv4.

   To create a socket in the IPv4 Internet namespace, use the symbolic
name 'PF_INET' of this namespace as the NAMESPACE argument to 'socket'
or 'socketpair'.  For IPv6 addresses you need the macro 'PF_INET6'.
These macros are defined in 'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Macro: int PF_INET

     This designates the IPv4 Internet namespace and associated family
     of protocols.

 -- Macro: int PF_INET6

     This designates the IPv6 Internet namespace and associated family
     of protocols.

   A socket address for the Internet namespace includes the following
components:

   * The address of the machine you want to connect to.  Internet
     addresses can be specified in several ways; these are discussed in
     *note Internet Address Formats::, *note Host Addresses:: and *note
     Host Names::.

   * A port number for that machine.  *Note Ports::.

   You must ensure that the address and port number are represented in a
canonical format called "network byte order".  *Note Byte Order::, for
information about this.

16.6.1 Internet Socket Address Formats
--------------------------------------

In the Internet namespace, for both IPv4 ('AF_INET') and IPv6
('AF_INET6'), a socket address consists of a host address and a port on
that host.  In addition, the protocol you choose serves effectively as a
part of the address because local port numbers are meaningful only
within a particular protocol.

   The data types for representing socket addresses in the Internet
namespace are defined in the header file 'netinet/in.h'.

 -- Data Type: struct sockaddr_in

     This is the data type used to represent socket addresses in the
     Internet namespace.  It has the following members:

     'sa_family_t sin_family'
          This identifies the address family or format of the socket
          address.  You should store the value 'AF_INET' in this member.
          *Note Socket Addresses::.

     'struct in_addr sin_addr'
          This is the Internet address of the host machine.  *Note Host
          Addresses::, and *note Host Names::, for how to get a value to
          store here.

     'unsigned short int sin_port'
          This is the port number.  *Note Ports::.

   When you call 'bind' or 'getsockname', you should specify 'sizeof
(struct sockaddr_in)' as the LENGTH parameter if you are using an IPv4
Internet namespace socket address.

 -- Data Type: struct sockaddr_in6
     This is the data type used to represent socket addresses in the
     IPv6 namespace.  It has the following members:

     'sa_family_t sin6_family'
          This identifies the address family or format of the socket
          address.  You should store the value of 'AF_INET6' in this
          member.  *Note Socket Addresses::.

     'struct in6_addr sin6_addr'
          This is the IPv6 address of the host machine.  *Note Host
          Addresses::, and *note Host Names::, for how to get a value to
          store here.

     'uint32_t sin6_flowinfo'
          This is a currently unimplemented field.

     'uint16_t sin6_port'
          This is the port number.  *Note Ports::.

16.6.2 Host Addresses
---------------------

Each computer on the Internet has one or more "Internet addresses",
numbers which identify that computer among all those on the Internet.
Users typically write IPv4 numeric host addresses as sequences of four
numbers, separated by periods, as in '128.52.46.32', and IPv6 numeric
host addresses as sequences of up to eight numbers separated by colons,
as in '5f03:1200:836f:c100::1'.

   Each computer also has one or more "host names", which are strings of
words separated by periods, as in 'www.gnu.org'.

   Programs that let the user specify a host typically accept both
numeric addresses and host names.  To open a connection a program needs
a numeric address, and so must convert a host name to the numeric
address it stands for.

16.6.2.1 Internet Host Addresses
..........----------------------

Each computer on the Internet has one or more Internet addresses,
numbers which identify that computer among all those on the Internet.

   An IPv4 Internet host address is a number containing four bytes of
data.  Historically these are divided into two parts, a "network number"
and a "local network address number" within that network.  In the
mid-1990s classless addresses were introduced which changed this
behavior.  Since some functions implicitly expect the old definitions,
we first describe the class-based network and will then describe
classless addresses.  IPv6 uses only classless addresses and therefore
the following paragraphs don't apply.

   The class-based IPv4 network number consists of the first one, two or
three bytes; the rest of the bytes are the local address.

   IPv4 network numbers are registered with the Network Information
Center (NIC), and are divided into three classes--A, B and C. The local
network address numbers of individual machines are registered with the
administrator of the particular network.

   Class A networks have single-byte numbers in the range 0 to 127.
There are only a small number of Class A networks, but they can each
support a very large number of hosts.  Medium-sized Class B networks
have two-byte network numbers, with the first byte in the range 128 to
191.  Class C networks are the smallest; they have three-byte network
numbers, with the first byte in the range 192-255.  Thus, the first 1,
2, or 3 bytes of an Internet address specify a network.  The remaining
bytes of the Internet address specify the address within that network.

   The Class A network 0 is reserved for broadcast to all networks.  In
addition, the host number 0 within each network is reserved for
broadcast to all hosts in that network.  These uses are obsolete now but
for compatibility reasons you shouldn't use network 0 and host number 0.

   The Class A network 127 is reserved for loopback; you can always use
the Internet address '127.0.0.1' to refer to the host machine.

   Since a single machine can be a member of multiple networks, it can
have multiple Internet host addresses.  However, there is never supposed
to be more than one machine with the same host address.

   There are four forms of the "standard numbers-and-dots notation" for
Internet addresses:

'A.B.C.D'
     This specifies all four bytes of the address individually and is
     the commonly used representation.

'A.B.C'
     The last part of the address, C, is interpreted as a 2-byte
     quantity.  This is useful for specifying host addresses in a Class
     B network with network address number 'A.B'.

'A.B'
     The last part of the address, B, is interpreted as a 3-byte
     quantity.  This is useful for specifying host addresses in a Class
     A network with network address number A.

'A'
     If only one part is given, this corresponds directly to the host
     address number.

   Within each part of the address, the usual C conventions for
specifying the radix apply.  In other words, a leading '0x' or '0X'
implies hexadecimal radix; a leading '0' implies octal; and otherwise
decimal radix is assumed.

Classless Addresses
..........---------

IPv4 addresses (and IPv6 addresses also) are now considered classless;
the distinction between classes A, B and C can be ignored.  Instead an
IPv4 host address consists of a 32-bit address and a 32-bit mask.  The
mask contains set bits for the network part and cleared bits for the
host part.  The network part is contiguous from the left, with the
remaining bits representing the host.  As a consequence, the netmask can
simply be specified as the number of set bits.  Classes A, B and C are
just special cases of this general rule.  For example, class A addresses
have a netmask of '255.0.0.0' or a prefix length of 8.

   Classless IPv4 network addresses are written in numbers-and-dots
notation with the prefix length appended and a slash as separator.  For
example the class A network 10 is written as '10.0.0.0/8'.

IPv6 Addresses
..........----

IPv6 addresses contain 128 bits (IPv4 has 32 bits) of data.  A host
address is usually written as eight 16-bit hexadecimal numbers that are
separated by colons.  Two colons are used to abbreviate strings of
consecutive zeros.  For example, the IPv6 loopback address
'0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1' can just be written as '::1'.

16.6.2.2 Host Address Data Type
..........---------------------

IPv4 Internet host addresses are represented in some contexts as
integers (type 'uint32_t').  In other contexts, the integer is packaged
inside a structure of type 'struct in_addr'.  It would be better if the
usage were made consistent, but it is not hard to extract the integer
from the structure or put the integer into a structure.

   You will find older code that uses 'unsigned long int' for IPv4
Internet host addresses instead of 'uint32_t' or 'struct in_addr'.
Historically 'unsigned long int' was a 32-bit number but with 64-bit
machines this has changed.  Using 'unsigned long int' might break the
code if it is used on machines where this type doesn't have 32 bits.
'uint32_t' is specified by Unix98 and guaranteed to have 32 bits.

   IPv6 Internet host addresses have 128 bits and are packaged inside a
structure of type 'struct in6_addr'.

   The following basic definitions for Internet addresses are declared
in the header file 'netinet/in.h':

 -- Data Type: struct in_addr

     This data type is used in certain contexts to contain an IPv4
     Internet host address.  It has just one field, named 's_addr',
     which records the host address number as an 'uint32_t'.

 -- Macro: uint32_t INADDR_LOOPBACK

     You can use this constant to stand for "the address of this
     machine," instead of finding its actual address.  It is the IPv4
     Internet address '127.0.0.1', which is usually called 'localhost'.
     This special constant saves you the trouble of looking up the
     address of your own machine.  Also, the system usually implements
     'INADDR_LOOPBACK' specially, avoiding any network traffic for the
     case of one machine talking to itself.

 -- Macro: uint32_t INADDR_ANY

     You can use this constant to stand for "any incoming address" when
     binding to an address.  *Note Setting Address::.  This is the usual
     address to give in the 'sin_addr' member of 'struct sockaddr_in'
     when you want to accept Internet connections.

 -- Macro: uint32_t INADDR_BROADCAST

     This constant is the address you use to send a broadcast message.

 -- Macro: uint32_t INADDR_NONE

     This constant is returned by some functions to indicate an error.

 -- Data Type: struct in6_addr

     This data type is used to store an IPv6 address.  It stores 128
     bits of data, which can be accessed (via a union) in a variety of
     ways.

 -- Constant: struct in6_addr in6addr_loopback

     This constant is the IPv6 address '::1', the loopback address.  See
     above for a description of what this means.  The macro
     'IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT' is provided to allow you to initialize your
     own variables to this value.

 -- Constant: struct in6_addr in6addr_any

     This constant is the IPv6 address '::', the unspecified address.
     See above for a description of what this means.  The macro
     'IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT' is provided to allow you to initialize your own
     variables to this value.

16.6.2.3 Host Address Functions
..........---------------------

These additional functions for manipulating Internet addresses are
declared in the header file 'arpa/inet.h'.  They represent Internet
addresses in network byte order, and network numbers and
local-address-within-network numbers in host byte order.  *Note Byte
Order::, for an explanation of network and host byte order.

 -- Function: int inet_aton (const char *NAME, struct in_addr *ADDR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function converts the IPv4 Internet host address NAME from the
     standard numbers-and-dots notation into binary data and stores it
     in the 'struct in_addr' that ADDR points to.  'inet_aton' returns
     nonzero if the address is valid, zero if not.

 -- Function: uint32_t inet_addr (const char *NAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function converts the IPv4 Internet host address NAME from the
     standard numbers-and-dots notation into binary data.  If the input
     is not valid, 'inet_addr' returns 'INADDR_NONE'.  This is an
     obsolete interface to 'inet_aton', described immediately above.  It
     is obsolete because 'INADDR_NONE' is a valid address
     (255.255.255.255), and 'inet_aton' provides a cleaner way to
     indicate error return.

 -- Function: uint32_t inet_network (const char *NAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function extracts the network number from the address NAME,
     given in the standard numbers-and-dots notation.  The returned
     address is in host order.  If the input is not valid,
     'inet_network' returns '-1'.

     The function works only with traditional IPv4 class A, B and C
     network types.  It doesn't work with classless addresses and
     shouldn't be used anymore.

 -- Function: char * inet_ntoa (struct in_addr ADDR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Unsafe race | AC-Safe | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function converts the IPv4 Internet host address ADDR to a
     string in the standard numbers-and-dots notation.  The return value
     is a pointer into a statically-allocated buffer.  Subsequent calls
     will overwrite the same buffer, so you should copy the string if
     you need to save it.

     In multi-threaded programs each thread has its own
     statically-allocated buffer.  But still subsequent calls of
     'inet_ntoa' in the same thread will overwrite the result of the
     last call.

     Instead of 'inet_ntoa' the newer function 'inet_ntop' which is
     described below should be used since it handles both IPv4 and IPv6
     addresses.

 -- Function: struct in_addr inet_makeaddr (uint32_t NET, uint32_t
          LOCAL)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function makes an IPv4 Internet host address by combining the
     network number NET with the local-address-within-network number
     LOCAL.

 -- Function: uint32_t inet_lnaof (struct in_addr ADDR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function returns the local-address-within-network part of the
     Internet host address ADDR.

     The function works only with traditional IPv4 class A, B and C
     network types.  It doesn't work with classless addresses and
     shouldn't be used anymore.

 -- Function: uint32_t inet_netof (struct in_addr ADDR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function returns the network number part of the Internet host
     address ADDR.

     The function works only with traditional IPv4 class A, B and C
     network types.  It doesn't work with classless addresses and
     shouldn't be used anymore.

 -- Function: int inet_pton (int AF, const char *CP, void *BUF)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function converts an Internet address (either IPv4 or IPv6)
     from presentation (textual) to network (binary) format.  AF should
     be either 'AF_INET' or 'AF_INET6', as appropriate for the type of
     address being converted.  CP is a pointer to the input string, and
     BUF is a pointer to a buffer for the result.  It is the caller's
     responsibility to make sure the buffer is large enough.

 -- Function: const char * inet_ntop (int AF, const void *CP, char *BUF,
          socklen_t LEN)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe locale | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function converts an Internet address (either IPv4 or IPv6)
     from network (binary) to presentation (textual) form.  AF should be
     either 'AF_INET' or 'AF_INET6', as appropriate.  CP is a pointer to
     the address to be converted.  BUF should be a pointer to a buffer
     to hold the result, and LEN is the length of this buffer.  The
     return value from the function will be this buffer address.

16.6.2.4 Host Names
..........---------

Besides the standard numbers-and-dots notation for Internet addresses,
you can also refer to a host by a symbolic name.  The advantage of a
symbolic name is that it is usually easier to remember.  For example,
the machine with Internet address '158.121.106.19' is also known as
'alpha.gnu.org'; and other machines in the 'gnu.org' domain can refer to
it simply as 'alpha'.

   Internally, the system uses a database to keep track of the mapping
between host names and host numbers.  This database is usually either
the file '/etc/hosts' or an equivalent provided by a name server.  The
functions and other symbols for accessing this database are declared in
'netdb.h'.  They are BSD features, defined unconditionally if you
include 'netdb.h'.

 -- Data Type: struct hostent

     This data type is used to represent an entry in the hosts database.
     It has the following members:

     'char *h_name'
          This is the "official" name of the host.

     'char **h_aliases'
          These are alternative names for the host, represented as a
          null-terminated vector of strings.

     'int h_addrtype'
          This is the host address type; in practice, its value is
          always either 'AF_INET' or 'AF_INET6', with the latter being
          used for IPv6 hosts.  In principle other kinds of addresses
          could be represented in the database as well as Internet
          addresses; if this were done, you might find a value in this
          field other than 'AF_INET' or 'AF_INET6'.  *Note Socket
          Addresses::.

     'int h_length'
          This is the length, in bytes, of each address.

     'char **h_addr_list'
          This is the vector of addresses for the host.  (Recall that
          the host might be connected to multiple networks and have
          different addresses on each one.)  The vector is terminated by
          a null pointer.

     'char *h_addr'
          This is a synonym for 'h_addr_list[0]'; in other words, it is
          the first host address.

   As far as the host database is concerned, each address is just a
block of memory 'h_length' bytes long.  But in other contexts there is
an implicit assumption that you can convert IPv4 addresses to a 'struct
in_addr' or an 'uint32_t'.  Host addresses in a 'struct hostent'
structure are always given in network byte order; see *note Byte
Order::.

   You can use 'gethostbyname', 'gethostbyname2' or 'gethostbyaddr' to
search the hosts database for information about a particular host.  The
information is returned in a statically-allocated structure; you must
copy the information if you need to save it across calls.  You can also
use 'getaddrinfo' and 'getnameinfo' to obtain this information.

 -- Function: struct hostent * gethostbyname (const char *NAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:hostbyname env locale | AS-Unsafe
     dlopen plugin corrupt heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt mem fd |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'gethostbyname' function returns information about the host
     named NAME.  If the lookup fails, it returns a null pointer.

 -- Function: struct hostent * gethostbyname2 (const char *NAME, int AF)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:hostbyname2 env locale | AS-Unsafe
     dlopen plugin corrupt heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt mem fd |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'gethostbyname2' function is like 'gethostbyname', but allows
     the caller to specify the desired address family (e.g. 'AF_INET' or
     'AF_INET6') of the result.

 -- Function: struct hostent * gethostbyaddr (const void *ADDR,
          socklen_t LENGTH, int FORMAT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:hostbyaddr env locale | AS-Unsafe
     dlopen plugin corrupt heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt mem fd |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'gethostbyaddr' function returns information about the host
     with Internet address ADDR.  The parameter ADDR is not really a
     pointer to char - it can be a pointer to an IPv4 or an IPv6
     address.  The LENGTH argument is the size (in bytes) of the address
     at ADDR.  FORMAT specifies the address format; for an IPv4 Internet
     address, specify a value of 'AF_INET'; for an IPv6 Internet
     address, use 'AF_INET6'.

     If the lookup fails, 'gethostbyaddr' returns a null pointer.

   If the name lookup by 'gethostbyname' or 'gethostbyaddr' fails, you
can find out the reason by looking at the value of the variable
'h_errno'.  (It would be cleaner design for these functions to set
'errno', but use of 'h_errno' is compatible with other systems.)

   Here are the error codes that you may find in 'h_errno':

'HOST_NOT_FOUND'

     No such host is known in the database.

'TRY_AGAIN'

     This condition happens when the name server could not be contacted.
     If you try again later, you may succeed then.

'NO_RECOVERY'

     A non-recoverable error occurred.

'NO_ADDRESS'

     The host database contains an entry for the name, but it doesn't
     have an associated Internet address.

   The lookup functions above all have one thing in common: they are not
reentrant and therefore unusable in multi-threaded applications.
Therefore provides the GNU C Library a new set of functions which can be
used in this context.

 -- Function: int gethostbyname_r (const char *restrict NAME, struct
          hostent *restrict RESULT_BUF, char *restrict BUF, size_t
          BUFLEN, struct hostent **restrict RESULT, int *restrict
          H_ERRNOP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe env locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin corrupt
     heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt mem fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'gethostbyname_r' function returns information about the host
     named NAME.  The caller must pass a pointer to an object of type
     'struct hostent' in the RESULT_BUF parameter.  In addition the
     function may need extra buffer space and the caller must pass a
     pointer and the size of the buffer in the BUF and BUFLEN
     parameters.

     A pointer to the buffer, in which the result is stored, is
     available in '*RESULT' after the function call successfully
     returned.  The buffer passed as the BUF parameter can be freed only
     once the caller has finished with the result hostent struct, or has
     copied it including all the other memory that it points to.  If an
     error occurs or if no entry is found, the pointer '*RESULT' is a
     null pointer.  Success is signalled by a zero return value.  If the
     function failed the return value is an error number.  In addition
     to the errors defined for 'gethostbyname' it can also be 'ERANGE'.
     In this case the call should be repeated with a larger buffer.
     Additional error information is not stored in the global variable
     'h_errno' but instead in the object pointed to by H_ERRNOP.

     Here's a small example:
          struct hostent *
          gethostname (char *host)
          {
            struct hostent *hostbuf, *hp;
            size_t hstbuflen;
            char *tmphstbuf;
            int res;
            int herr;

            hostbuf = malloc (sizeof (struct hostent));
            hstbuflen = 1024;
            tmphstbuf = malloc (hstbuflen);

            while ((res = gethostbyname_r (host, hostbuf, tmphstbuf, hstbuflen,
                                           &hp, &herr)) == ERANGE)
              {
                /* Enlarge the buffer.  */
                hstbuflen *= 2;
                tmphstbuf = realloc (tmphstbuf, hstbuflen);
              }

            free (tmphstbuf);
            /*  Check for errors.  */
            if (res || hp == NULL)
              return NULL;
            return hp;
          }

 -- Function: int gethostbyname2_r (const char *NAME, int AF, struct
          hostent *restrict RESULT_BUF, char *restrict BUF, size_t
          BUFLEN, struct hostent **restrict RESULT, int *restrict
          H_ERRNOP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe env locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin corrupt
     heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt mem fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'gethostbyname2_r' function is like 'gethostbyname_r', but
     allows the caller to specify the desired address family (e.g.
     'AF_INET' or 'AF_INET6') for the result.

 -- Function: int gethostbyaddr_r (const void *ADDR, socklen_t LENGTH,
          int FORMAT, struct hostent *restrict RESULT_BUF, char
          *restrict BUF, size_t BUFLEN, struct hostent **restrict
          RESULT, int *restrict H_ERRNOP)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe env locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin corrupt
     heap lock | AC-Unsafe lock corrupt mem fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'gethostbyaddr_r' function returns information about the host
     with Internet address ADDR.  The parameter ADDR is not really a
     pointer to char - it can be a pointer to an IPv4 or an IPv6
     address.  The LENGTH argument is the size (in bytes) of the address
     at ADDR.  FORMAT specifies the address format; for an IPv4 Internet
     address, specify a value of 'AF_INET'; for an IPv6 Internet
     address, use 'AF_INET6'.

     Similar to the 'gethostbyname_r' function, the caller must provide
     buffers for the result and memory used internally.  In case of
     success the function returns zero.  Otherwise the value is an error
     number where 'ERANGE' has the special meaning that the
     caller-provided buffer is too small.

   You can also scan the entire hosts database one entry at a time using
'sethostent', 'gethostent' and 'endhostent'.  Be careful when using
these functions because they are not reentrant.

 -- Function: void sethostent (int STAYOPEN)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:hostent env locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function opens the hosts database to begin scanning it.  You
     can then call 'gethostent' to read the entries.

     If the STAYOPEN argument is nonzero, this sets a flag so that
     subsequent calls to 'gethostbyname' or 'gethostbyaddr' will not
     close the database (as they usually would).  This makes for more
     efficiency if you call those functions several times, by avoiding
     reopening the database for each call.

 -- Function: struct hostent * gethostent (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:hostent race:hostentbuf env locale |
     AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns the next entry in the hosts database.  It
     returns a null pointer if there are no more entries.

 -- Function: void endhostent (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:hostent env locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function closes the hosts database.

16.6.3 Internet Ports
---------------------

A socket address in the Internet namespace consists of a machine's
Internet address plus a "port number" which distinguishes the sockets on
a given machine (for a given protocol).  Port numbers range from 0 to
65,535.

   Port numbers less than 'IPPORT_RESERVED' are reserved for standard
servers, such as 'finger' and 'telnet'.  There is a database that keeps
track of these, and you can use the 'getservbyname' function to map a
service name onto a port number; see *note Services Database::.

   If you write a server that is not one of the standard ones defined in
the database, you must choose a port number for it.  Use a number
greater than 'IPPORT_USERRESERVED'; such numbers are reserved for
servers and won't ever be generated automatically by the system.
Avoiding conflicts with servers being run by other users is up to you.

   When you use a socket without specifying its address, the system
generates a port number for it.  This number is between
'IPPORT_RESERVED' and 'IPPORT_USERRESERVED'.

   On the Internet, it is actually legitimate to have two different
sockets with the same port number, as long as they never both try to
communicate with the same socket address (host address plus port
number).  You shouldn't duplicate a port number except in special
circumstances where a higher-level protocol requires it.  Normally, the
system won't let you do it; 'bind' normally insists on distinct port
numbers.  To reuse a port number, you must set the socket option
'SO_REUSEADDR'.  *Note Socket-Level Options::.

   These macros are defined in the header file 'netinet/in.h'.

 -- Macro: int IPPORT_RESERVED

     Port numbers less than 'IPPORT_RESERVED' are reserved for superuser
     use.

 -- Macro: int IPPORT_USERRESERVED

     Port numbers greater than or equal to 'IPPORT_USERRESERVED' are
     reserved for explicit use; they will never be allocated
     automatically.

16.6.4 The Services Database
----------------------------

The database that keeps track of "well-known" services is usually either
the file '/etc/services' or an equivalent from a name server.  You can
use these utilities, declared in 'netdb.h', to access the services
database.

 -- Data Type: struct servent

     This data type holds information about entries from the services
     database.  It has the following members:

     'char *s_name'
          This is the "official" name of the service.

     'char **s_aliases'
          These are alternate names for the service, represented as an
          array of strings.  A null pointer terminates the array.

     'int s_port'
          This is the port number for the service.  Port numbers are
          given in network byte order; see *note Byte Order::.

     'char *s_proto'
          This is the name of the protocol to use with this service.
          *Note Protocols Database::.

   To get information about a particular service, use the
'getservbyname' or 'getservbyport' functions.  The information is
returned in a statically-allocated structure; you must copy the
information if you need to save it across calls.

 -- Function: struct servent * getservbyname (const char *NAME, const
          char *PROTO)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:servbyname locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     The 'getservbyname' function returns information about the service
     named NAME using protocol PROTO.  If it can't find such a service,
     it returns a null pointer.

     This function is useful for servers as well as for clients; servers
     use it to determine which port they should listen on (*note
     Listening::).

 -- Function: struct servent * getservbyport (int PORT, const char
          *PROTO)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:servbyport locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     The 'getservbyport' function returns information about the service
     at port PORT using protocol PROTO.  If it can't find such a
     service, it returns a null pointer.

You can also scan the services database using 'setservent', 'getservent'
and 'endservent'.  Be careful when using these functions because they
are not reentrant.

 -- Function: void setservent (int STAYOPEN)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:servent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function opens the services database to begin scanning it.

     If the STAYOPEN argument is nonzero, this sets a flag so that
     subsequent calls to 'getservbyname' or 'getservbyport' will not
     close the database (as they usually would).  This makes for more
     efficiency if you call those functions several times, by avoiding
     reopening the database for each call.

 -- Function: struct servent * getservent (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:servent race:serventbuf locale |
     AS-Unsafe dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem |
     *Note POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     This function returns the next entry in the services database.  If
     there are no more entries, it returns a null pointer.

 -- Function: void endservent (void)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:servent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function closes the services database.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        *Byte_Order*

16.6.5 Byte Order Conversion
----------------------------

Different kinds of computers use different conventions for the ordering
of bytes within a word.  Some computers put the most significant byte
within a word first (this is called "big-endian" order), and others put
it last ("little-endian" order).

   So that machines with different byte order conventions can
communicate, the Internet protocols specify a canonical byte order
convention for data transmitted over the network.  This is known as
"network byte order".

   When establishing an Internet socket connection, you must make sure
that the data in the 'sin_port' and 'sin_addr' members of the
'sockaddr_in' structure are represented in network byte order.  If you
are encoding integer data in the messages sent through the socket, you
should convert this to network byte order too.  If you don't do this,
your program may fail when running on or talking to other kinds of
machines.

   If you use 'getservbyname' and 'gethostbyname' or 'inet_addr' to get
the port number and host address, the values are already in network byte
order, and you can copy them directly into the 'sockaddr_in' structure.

   Otherwise, you have to convert the values explicitly.  Use 'htons'
and 'ntohs' to convert values for the 'sin_port' member.  Use 'htonl'
and 'ntohl' to convert IPv4 addresses for the 'sin_addr' member.
(Remember, 'struct in_addr' is equivalent to 'uint32_t'.)  These
functions are declared in 'netinet/in.h'.

 -- Function: uint16_t htons (uint16_t HOSTSHORT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function converts the 'uint16_t' integer HOSTSHORT from host
     byte order to network byte order.

 -- Function: uint16_t ntohs (uint16_t NETSHORT)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function converts the 'uint16_t' integer NETSHORT from network
     byte order to host byte order.

 -- Function: uint32_t htonl (uint32_t HOSTLONG)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function converts the 'uint32_t' integer HOSTLONG from host

 -- Function: uint32_t ntohl (uint32_t NETLONG)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety

     This function converts the 'uint32_t' integer NETLONG from network

16.6.6 Protocols Database
-------------------------

The communications protocol used with a socket controls low-level
details of how data are exchanged.  For example, the protocol implements
things like checksums to detect errors in transmissions, and routing
instructions for messages.  Normal user programs have little reason to
mess with these details directly.

   The default communications protocol for the Internet namespace
depends on the communication style.  For stream communication, the
default is TCP ("transmission control protocol").  For datagram
communication, the default is UDP ("user datagram protocol").  For
reliable datagram communication, the default is RDP ("reliable datagram
protocol").  You should nearly always use the default.

   Internet protocols are generally specified by a name instead of a
number.  The network protocols that a host knows about are stored in a
database.  This is usually either derived from the file
'/etc/protocols', or it may be an equivalent provided by a name server.
You look up the protocol number associated with a named protocol in the
database using the 'getprotobyname' function.

   Here are detailed descriptions of the utilities for accessing the
protocols database.  These are declared in 'netdb.h'.

 -- Data Type: struct protoent

     This data type is used to represent entries in the network
     protocols database.  It has the following members:

     'char *p_name'
          This is the official name of the protocol.

     'char **p_aliases'
          These are alternate names for the protocol, specified as an
          array of strings.  The last element of the array is a null
          pointer.

     'int p_proto'
          This is the protocol number (in host byte order); use this
          member as the PROTOCOL argument to 'socket'.

   You can use 'getprotobyname' and 'getprotobynumber' to search the
protocols database for a specific protocol.  The information is returned
in a statically-allocated structure; you must copy the information if
you need to save it across calls.

 -- Function: struct protoent * getprotobyname (const char *NAME)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:protobyname locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     The 'getprotobyname' function returns information about the network
     protocol named NAME.  If there is no such protocol, it returns a
     null pointer.

 -- Function: struct protoent * getprotobynumber (int PROTOCOL)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:protobynumber locale | AS-Unsafe
     dlopen plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note
     POSIX Safety Concepts::.

     The 'getprotobynumber' function returns information about the
     network protocol with number PROTOCOL.  If there is no such
     protocol, it returns a null pointer.

   You can also scan the whole protocols database one protocol at a time
by using 'setprotoent', 'getprotoent' and 'endprotoent'.  Be careful
when using these functions because they are not reentrant.

 -- Function: void setprotoent (int STAYOPEN)

     Preliminary: | MT-Unsafe race:protoent locale | AS-Unsafe dlopen
     plugin heap lock | AC-Unsafe corrupt lock fd mem | *Note POSIX
     Safety Concepts::.

     This function opens the protocols database to begin scanning it.

     If the STAYOPEN argument is nonzero, this sets a flag so that
     subsequent calls to 'getprotobyname' or 'getprotobynumber' will not
     close the database (as they usually would).  This makes for more

16.6.7 Internet Socket Example
------------------------------

Here is an example showing how to create and name a socket in the
Internet namespace.  The newly created socket exists on the machine that
the program is running on.  Rather than finding and using the machine's
Internet address, this example specifies 'INADDR_ANY' as the host
address; the system replaces that with the machine's actual address.


     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netinet/in.h>

     int
     make_socket (uint16_t port)
     {
       int sock;
       struct sockaddr_in name;

       /* Create the socket. */
       sock = socket (PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
       if (sock < 0)
         {
           perror ("socket");
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

       /* Give the socket a name. */
       name.sin_family = AF_INET;
       name.sin_port = htons (port);
       name.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl (INADDR_ANY);
       if (bind (sock, (struct sockaddr *) &name, sizeof (name)) < 0)
         {
           perror ("bind");
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }

       return sock;
     }

   Here is another example, showing how you can fill in a 'sockaddr_in'
structure, given a host name string and a port number:


     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <sys/socket.h>
     #include <netinet/in.h>
     #include <netdb.h>

     void
     init_sockaddr (struct sockaddr_in *name,
                    const char *hostname,
                    uint16_t port)
     {
       struct hostent *hostinfo;

       name->sin_family = AF_INET;
       name->sin_port = htons (port);
       hostinfo = gethostbyname (hostname);
       if (hostinfo == NULL)
         {
           fprintf (stderr, "Unknown host %s.\n", hostname);
           exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
         }
       name->sin_addr = *(struct in_addr *) hostinfo->h_addr;
     }

16.7 Other Namespaces
==========-----------

Certain other namespaces and associated protocol families are supported
but not documented yet because they are not often used.  'PF_NS' refers
to the Xerox Network Software protocols.  'PF_ISO' stands for Open
Systems Interconnect.  'PF_CCITT' refers to protocols from CCITT.
'socket.h' defines these symbols and others naming protocols not
actually implemented.

   'PF_IMPLINK' is used for communicating between hosts and Internet
Message Processors.  For information on this and 'PF_ROUTE', an
occasionally-used local area routing protocol, see the GNU Hurd Manual
(to appear in the future).

16.8.1 Creating a Socket
------------------------

The primitive for creating a socket is the 'socket' function, declared
in 'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Function: int socket (int NAMESPACE, int STYLE, int PROTOCOL)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function creates a socket and specifies communication style
     STYLE, which should be one of the socket styles listed in *note
     Communication Styles::.  The NAMESPACE argument specifies the
     namespace; it must be 'PF_LOCAL' (*note Local Namespace::) or
     'PF_INET' (*note Internet Namespace::).  PROTOCOL designates the
     specific protocol (*note Socket Concepts::); zero is usually right
     for PROTOCOL.

     The return value from 'socket' is the file descriptor for the new
     socket, or '-1' in case of error.  The following 'errno' error
     conditions are defined for this function:

     'EPROTONOSUPPORT'
          The PROTOCOL or STYLE is not supported by the NAMESPACE
          specified.

     'EMFILE'
          The process already has too many file descriptors open.

     'ENFILE'
          The system already has too many file descriptors open.

     'EACCES'
          The process does not have the privilege to create a socket of
          the specified STYLE or PROTOCOL.

     'ENOBUFS'
          The system ran out of internal buffer space.

     The file descriptor returned by the 'socket' function supports both
     read and write operations.  However, like pipes, sockets do not
     support file positioning operations.

   For examples of how to call the 'socket' function, see *note Local
Socket Example::, or *note Inet Example::.

16.8.2 Closing a Socket
-----------------------

When you have finished using a socket, you can simply close its file
descriptor with 'close'; see *note Opening and Closing Files::.  If
there is still data waiting to be transmitted over the connection,
normally 'close' tries to complete this transmission.  You can control
this behavior using the 'SO_LINGER' socket option to specify a timeout
period; see *note Socket Options::.

   You can also shut down only reception or transmission on a connection
by calling 'shutdown', which is declared in 'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Function: int shutdown (int SOCKET, int HOW)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'shutdown' function shuts down the connection of socket SOCKET.
     The argument HOW specifies what action to perform:

     '0'
          Stop receiving data for this socket.  If further data arrives,
          reject it.

     '1'
          Stop trying to transmit data from this socket.  Discard any
          data waiting to be sent.  Stop looking for acknowledgement of
          data already sent; don't retransmit it if it is lost.

     '2'
          Stop both reception and transmission.

     The return value is '0' on success and '-1' on failure.  The
     following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          SOCKET is not a valid file descriptor.

     'ENOTSOCK'
          SOCKET is not a socket.

     'ENOTCONN'
          SOCKET is not connected.

16.8.3 Socket Pairs
-------------------

A "socket pair" consists of a pair of connected (but unnamed) sockets.
It is very similar to a pipe and is used in much the same way.  Socket
pairs are created with the 'socketpair' function, declared in
'sys/socket.h'.  A socket pair is much like a pipe; the main difference
is that the socket pair is bidirectional, whereas the pipe has one
input-only end and one output-only end (*note Pipes and FIFOs::).

 -- Function: int socketpair (int NAMESPACE, int STYLE, int PROTOCOL,
          int FILEDES[2])

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function creates a socket pair, returning the file descriptors
     in 'FILEDES[0]' and 'FILEDES[1]'.  The socket pair is a full-duplex
     communications channel, so that both reading and writing may be
     performed at either end.

     The NAMESPACE, STYLE and PROTOCOL arguments are interpreted as for
     the 'socket' function.  STYLE should be one of the communication
     styles listed in *note Communication Styles::.  The NAMESPACE
     argument specifies the namespace, which must be 'AF_LOCAL' (*note
     Local Namespace::); PROTOCOL specifies the communications protocol,
     but zero is the only meaningful value.

     If STYLE specifies a connectionless communication style, then the
     two sockets you get are not _connected_, strictly speaking, but
     each of them knows the other as the default destination address, so
     they can send packets to each other.

     The 'socketpair' function returns '0' on success and '-1' on
     failure.  The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

     'EMFILE'
          The process has too many file descriptors open.

     'EAFNOSUPPORT'
          The specified namespace is not supported.

     'EPROTONOSUPPORT'
          The specified protocol is not supported.

     'EOPNOTSUPP'
          The specified protocol does not support the creation of socket
          pairs.

16.9 Using Sockets with Connections
==========-------------------------

The most common communication styles involve making a connection to a
particular other socket, and then exchanging data with that socket over
and over.  Making a connection is asymmetric; one side (the "client")
acts to request a connection, while the other side (the "server") makes
a socket and waits for the connection request.

16.9.1 Making a Connection
--------------------------

In making a connection, the client makes a connection while the server
waits for and accepts the connection.  Here we discuss what the client
program must do with the 'connect' function, which is declared in
'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Function: int connect (int SOCKET, struct sockaddr *ADDR, socklen_t
          LENGTH)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'connect' function initiates a connection from the socket with
     file descriptor SOCKET to the socket whose address is specified by
     the ADDR and LENGTH arguments.  (This socket is typically on
     another machine, and it must be already set up as a server.)  *Note
     Socket Addresses::, for information about how these arguments are
     interpreted.

     Normally, 'connect' waits until the server responds to the request
     before it returns.  You can set nonblocking mode on the socket
     SOCKET to make 'connect' return immediately without waiting for the
     response.  *Note File Status Flags::, for information about
     nonblocking mode.

     The normal return value from 'connect' is '0'.  If an error occurs,
     'connect' returns '-1'.  The following 'errno' error conditions are
     defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The socket SOCKET is not a valid file descriptor.

     'ENOTSOCK'
          File descriptor SOCKET is not a socket.

     'EADDRNOTAVAIL'
          The specified address is not available on the remote machine.

     'EAFNOSUPPORT'
          The namespace of the ADDR is not supported by this socket.

     'EISCONN'
          The socket SOCKET is already connected.

     'ETIMEDOUT'
          The attempt to establish the connection timed out.

     'ECONNREFUSED'
          The server has actively refused to establish the connection.

     'ENETUNREACH'
          The network of the given ADDR isn't reachable from this host.

     'EADDRINUSE'
          The socket address of the given ADDR is already in use.

     'EINPROGRESS'
          The socket SOCKET is non-blocking and the connection could not
          be established immediately.  You can determine when the
          connection is completely established with 'select'; *note
          Waiting for I/O::.  Another 'connect' call on the same socket,
          before the connection is completely established, will fail
          with 'EALREADY'.

     'EALREADY'
          The socket SOCKET is non-blocking and already has a pending
          connection in progress (see 'EINPROGRESS' above).

     This function is defined as a cancellation point in multi-threaded
     programs, so one has to be prepared for this and make sure that

16.9.2 Listening for Connections
--------------------------------

Now let us consider what the server process must do to accept
connections on a socket.  First it must use the 'listen' function to
enable connection requests on the socket, and then accept each incoming
connection with a call to 'accept' (*note Accepting Connections::).
Once connection requests are enabled on a server socket, the 'select'
function reports when the socket has a connection ready to be accepted
(*note Waiting for I/O::).

   The 'listen' function is not allowed for sockets using connectionless
communication styles.

   You can write a network server that does not even start running until
a connection to it is requested.  *Note Inetd Servers::.

   In the Internet namespace, there are no special protection mechanisms
for controlling access to a port; any process on any machine can make a
connection to your server.  If you want to restrict access to your
server, make it examine the addresses associated with connection
requests or implement some other handshaking or identification protocol.

   In the local namespace, the ordinary file protection bits control who
has access to connect to the socket.

 -- Function: int listen (int SOCKET, int N)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'listen' function enables the socket SOCKET to accept
     connections, thus making it a server socket.

     The argument N specifies the length of the queue for pending
     connections.  When the queue fills, new clients attempting to
     connect fail with 'ECONNREFUSED' until the server calls 'accept' to
     accept a connection from the queue.

     The 'listen' function returns '0' on success and '-1' on failure.
     The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

     'EBADF'
          The argument SOCKET is not a valid file descriptor.

     'ENOTSOCK'
          The argument SOCKET is not a socket.

     'EOPNOTSUPP'
          The socket SOCKET does not support this operation.

16.9.3 Accepting Connections
----------------------------

When a server receives a connection request, it can complete the
connection by accepting the request.  Use the function 'accept' to do
this.

   A socket that has been established as a server can accept connection
requests from multiple clients.  The server's original socket _does not
become part of the connection_; instead, 'accept' makes a new socket
which participates in the connection.  'accept' returns the descriptor
for this socket.  The server's original socket remains available for
listening for further connection requests.

   The number of pending connection requests on a server socket is
finite.  If connection requests arrive from clients faster than the
server can act upon them, the queue can fill up and additional requests
are refused with an 'ECONNREFUSED' error.  You can specify the maximum
length of this queue as an argument to the 'listen' function, although
the system may also impose its own internal limit on the length of this
queue.

 -- Function: int accept (int SOCKET, struct sockaddr *ADDR, socklen_t
          *LENGTH_PTR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe fd | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     This function is used to accept a connection request on the server
     socket SOCKET.

     The 'accept' function waits if there are no connections pending,
     unless the socket SOCKET has nonblocking mode set.  (You can use
     'select' to wait for a pending connection, with a nonblocking
     socket.)  *Note File Status Flags::, for information about
     nonblocking mode.

     The ADDR and LENGTH-PTR arguments are used to return information
     about the name of the client socket that initiated the connection.
     *Note Socket Addresses::, for information about the format of the
     information.

     Accepting a connection does not make SOCKET part of the connection.
     Instead, it creates a new socket which becomes connected.  The
     normal return value of 'accept' is the file descriptor for the new
     socket.

     After 'accept', the original socket SOCKET remains open and
     unconnected, and continues listening until you close it.  You can
     accept further connections with SOCKET by calling 'accept' again.

     If an error occurs, 'accept' returns '-1'.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The SOCKET argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'ENOTSOCK'
          The descriptor SOCKET argument is not a socket.

     'EOPNOTSUPP'
          The descriptor SOCKET does not support this operation.

     'EWOULDBLOCK'
          SOCKET has nonblocking mode set, and there are no pending
          connections immediately available.

     This function is defined as a cancellation point in multi-threaded
     programs, so one has to be prepared for this and make sure that
     allocated resources (like memory, file descriptors, semaphores or
     whatever) are freed even if the thread is canceled.

   The 'accept' function is not allowed for sockets using connectionless
communication styles.

16.9.4 Who is Connected to Me?
------------------------------

 -- Function: int getpeername (int SOCKET, struct sockaddr *ADDR,
          socklen_t *LENGTH-PTR)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'getpeername' function returns the address of the socket that
     SOCKET is connected to; it stores the address in the memory space
     specified by ADDR and LENGTH-PTR.  It stores the length of the
     address in '*LENGTH-PTR'.

     *Note Socket Addresses::, for information about the format of the
     address.  In some operating systems, 'getpeername' works only for
     sockets in the Internet domain.

     The return value is '0' on success and '-1' on error.  The
     following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The argument SOCKET is not a valid file descriptor.

          The descriptor SOCKET is not a socket.

     'ENOTCONN'
          The socket SOCKET is not connected.

16.9.5 Transferring Data
------------------------

Once a socket has been connected to a peer, you can use the ordinary
'read' and 'write' operations (*note I/O Primitives::) to transfer data.
A socket is a two-way communications channel, so read and write
operations can be performed at either end.

   There are also some I/O modes that are specific to socket operations.
In order to specify these modes, you must use the 'recv' and 'send'
functions instead of the more generic 'read' and 'write' functions.  The
'recv' and 'send' functions take an additional argument which you can
use to specify various flags to control special I/O modes.  For example,
you can specify the 'MSG_OOB' flag to read or write out-of-band data,
the 'MSG_PEEK' flag to peek at input, or the 'MSG_DONTROUTE' flag to
control inclusion of routing information on output.

16.9.5.1 Sending Data
..........-----------

The 'send' function is declared in the header file 'sys/socket.h'.  If
your FLAGS argument is zero, you can just as well use 'write' instead of
'send'; see *note I/O Primitives::.  If the socket was connected but the
connection has broken, you get a 'SIGPIPE' signal for any use of 'send'
or 'write' (*note Miscellaneous Signals::).

 -- Function: ssize_t send (int SOCKET, const void *BUFFER, size_t SIZE,
          int FLAGS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'send' function is like 'write', but with the additional flags
     FLAGS.  The possible values of FLAGS are described in *note Socket
     Data Options::.

     This function returns the number of bytes transmitted, or '-1' on
     failure.  If the socket is nonblocking, then 'send' (like 'write')
     can return after sending just part of the data.  *Note File Status
     Flags::, for information about nonblocking mode.

     Note, however, that a successful return value merely indicates that
     the message has been sent without error, not necessarily that it
     has been received without error.

     The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for this
     function:

     'EBADF'
          The SOCKET argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal before any data was
          sent.  *Note Interrupted Primitives::.

     'ENOTSOCK'
          The descriptor SOCKET is not a socket.

     'EMSGSIZE'
          The socket type requires that the message be sent atomically,
          but the message is too large for this to be possible.

     'EWOULDBLOCK'
          Nonblocking mode has been set on the socket, and the write
          operation would block.  (Normally 'send' blocks until the
          operation can be completed.)

     'ENOBUFS'
          There is not enough internal buffer space available.

     'ENOTCONN'
          You never connected this socket.

     'EPIPE'
          This socket was connected but the connection is now broken.
          In this case, 'send' generates a 'SIGPIPE' signal first; if
          that signal is ignored or blocked, or if its handler returns,
          then 'send' fails with 'EPIPE'.

     This function is defined as a cancellation point in multi-threaded
     programs, so one has to be prepared for this and make sure that
     allocated resources (like memory, file descriptors, semaphores or
     whatever) are freed even if the thread is canceled.

16.9.5.2 Receiving Data
..........-------------

The 'recv' function is declared in the header file 'sys/socket.h'.  If
your FLAGS argument is zero, you can just as well use 'read' instead of
'recv'; see *note I/O Primitives::.

 -- Function: ssize_t recv (int SOCKET, void *BUFFER, size_t SIZE, int
          FLAGS)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety

     The 'recv' function is like 'read', but with the additional flags
     FLAGS.  The possible values of FLAGS are described in *note Socket
     Data Options::.

     If nonblocking mode is set for SOCKET, and no data are available to
     be read, 'recv' fails immediately rather than waiting.  *Note File
     Status Flags::, for information about nonblocking mode.

     This function returns the number of bytes received, or '-1' on
     failure.  The following 'errno' error conditions are defined for
     this function:

     'EBADF'
          The SOCKET argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'ENOTSOCK'
          The descriptor SOCKET is not a socket.

     'EWOULDBLOCK'
          Nonblocking mode has been set on the socket, and the read
          operation would block.  (Normally, 'recv' blocks until there
          is input available to be read.)

     'EINTR'
          The operation was interrupted by a signal before any data was
          read.  *Note Interrupted Primitives::.

16.9.5.3 Socket Data Options
..........------------------

The FLAGS argument to 'send' and 'recv' is a bit mask.  You can
bitwise-OR the values of the following macros together to obtain a value
for this argument.  All are defined in the header file 'sys/socket.h'.

 -- Macro: int MSG_OOB

     Send or receive out-of-band data.  *Note Out-of-Band Data::.

 -- Macro: int MSG_PEEK

     Look at the data but don't remove it from the input queue.  This is
     only meaningful with input functions such as 'recv', not with
     'send'.

 -- Macro: int MSG_DONTROUTE

     Don't include routing information in the message.  This is only
     meaningful with output operations, and is usually only of interest
     for diagnostic or routing programs.  We don't try to explain it
     here.

16.9.6 Byte Stream Socket Example

Here is an example client program that makes a connection for a byte
stream socket in the Internet namespace.  It doesn't do anything
particularly interesting once it has connected to the server; it just
sends a text string to the server and exits.

   This program uses 'init_sockaddr' to set up the socket address; see
*note Inet Example::.

16.9.7 Byte Stream Connection Server Example
--------------------------------------------

The server end is much more complicated.  Since we want to allow
multiple clients to be connected to the server at the same time, it
would be incorrect to wait for input from a single client by simply
calling 'read' or 'recv'.  Instead, the right thing to do is to use
'select' (*note Waiting for I/O::) to wait for input on all of the open
sockets.  This also allows the server to deal with additional connection
requests.

   This particular server doesn't do anything interesting once it has
gotten a message from a client.  It does close the socket for that
client when it detects an end-of-file condition (resulting from the
client shutting down its end of the connection).

   This program uses 'make_socket' to set up the socket address; see
*note Inet Example::.

16.9.8 Out-of-Band Data
-----------------------

Streams with connections permit "out-of-band" data that is delivered
with higher priority than ordinary data.  Typically the reason for
sending out-of-band data is to send notice of an exceptional condition.
To send out-of-band data use 'send', specifying the flag 'MSG_OOB'
(*note Sending Data::).

   Out-of-band data are received with higher priority because the
receiving process need not read it in sequence; to read the next
available out-of-band data, use 'recv' with the 'MSG_OOB' flag (*note
Receiving Data::).  Ordinary read operations do not read out-of-band
data; they read only ordinary data.

   When a socket finds that out-of-band data are on their way, it sends
a 'SIGURG' signal to the owner process or process group of the socket.
You can specify the owner using the 'F_SETOWN' command to the 'fcntl'
function; see *note Interrupt Input::.  You must also establish a
handler for this signal, as described in *note Signal Handling::, in
order to take appropriate action such as reading the out-of-band data.

   Alternatively, you can test for pending out-of-band data, or wait
until there is out-of-band data, using the 'select' function; it can
wait for an exceptional condition on the socket.  *Note Waiting for
I/O::, for more information about 'select'.

   Notification of out-of-band data (whether with 'SIGURG' or with
'select') indicates that out-of-band data are on the way; the data may
not actually arrive until later.  If you try to read the out-of-band
data before it arrives, 'recv' fails with an 'EWOULDBLOCK' error.

   Sending out-of-band data automatically places a "mark" in the stream
of ordinary data, showing where in the sequence the out-of-band data
"would have been".  This is useful when the meaning of out-of-band data
is "cancel everything sent so far".  Here is how you can test, in the
receiving process, whether any ordinary data was sent before the mark:

     success = ioctl (socket, SIOCATMARK, &atmark);

   The 'integer' variable ATMARK is set to a nonzero value if the
socket's read pointer has reached the "mark".

   Here's a function to discard any ordinary data preceding the
out-of-band mark:

     int
     discard_until_mark (int socket)
     {
       while (1)
         {
           /* This is not an arbitrary limit; any size will do.  */
           char buffer[1024];
           int atmark, success;

           /* If we have reached the mark, return.  */
           success = ioctl (socket, SIOCATMARK, &atmark);
           if (success < 0)
             perror ("ioctl");
           if (result)
             return;

           /* Otherwise, read a bunch of ordinary data and discard it.
              This is guaranteed not to read past the mark
              if it starts before the mark.  */
           success = read (socket, buffer, sizeof buffer);
           if (success < 0)
             perror ("read");
         }
     }

   If you don't want to discard the ordinary data preceding the mark,
you may need to read some of it anyway, to make room in internal system
buffers for the out-of-band data.  If you try to read out-of-band data
and get an 'EWOULDBLOCK' error, try reading some ordinary data (saving
it so that you can use it when you want it) and see if that makes room.
Here is an example:

     struct buffer
     {
       char *buf;
       int size;
       struct buffer *next;
     };

     /* Read the out-of-band data from SOCKET and return it
        as a 'struct buffer', which records the address of the data
        and its size.

        It may be necessary to read some ordinary data
        in order to make room for the out-of-band data.
        If so, the ordinary data are saved as a chain of buffers
        found in the 'next' field of the value.  */

     struct buffer *
     read_oob (int socket)
     {
       struct buffer *tail = 0;
       struct buffer *list = 0;

       while (1)
         {
           /* This is an arbitrary limit.
              Does anyone know how to do this without a limit?  */
     #define BUF_SZ 1024
           char *buf = (char *) xmalloc (BUF_SZ);
           int success;
           int atmark;

           /* Try again to read the out-of-band data.  */
           success = recv (socket, buf, BUF_SZ, MSG_OOB);
           if (success >= 0)
             {
               /* We got it, so return it.  */
               struct buffer *link
                 = (struct buffer *) xmalloc (sizeof (struct buffer));
               link->buf = buf;
               link->size = success;
               link->next = list;
               return link;
             }

               sleep (1);
               continue;
             }

           /* Otherwise, read a bunch of ordinary data and save it.
              This is guaranteed not to read past the mark
              if it starts before the mark.  */
           success = read (socket, buf, BUF_SZ);

16.10 Datagram Socket Operations
==========----------------------

This section describes how to use communication styles that don't use
connections (styles 'SOCK_DGRAM' and 'SOCK_RDM').  Using these styles,
you group data into packets and each packet is an independent
communication.  You specify the destination for each packet
individually.

   Datagram packets are like letters: you send each one independently
with its own destination address, and they may arrive in the wrong order
or not at all.

   The 'listen' and 'accept' functions are not allowed for sockets using
connectionless communication styles.

16.10.1 Sending Datagrams
-------------------------

The normal way of sending data on a datagram socket is by using the
'sendto' function, declared in 'sys/socket.h'.

   You can call 'connect' on a datagram socket, but this only specifies
a default destination for further data transmission on the socket.  When
a socket has a default destination you can use 'send' (*note Sending
Data::) or even 'write' (*note I/O Primitives::) to send a packet there.
You can cancel the default destination by calling 'connect' using an
address format of 'AF_UNSPEC' in the ADDR argument.  *Note Connecting::,
for more information about the 'connect' function.

 -- Function: ssize_t sendto (int SOCKET, const void *BUFFER, size_t
          SIZE, int FLAGS, struct sockaddr *ADDR, socklen_t LENGTH)

     Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | *Note POSIX Safety
     Concepts::.

     The 'sendto' function transmits the data in the BUFFER through the
     socket SOCKET to the destination address specified by the ADDR and
     LENGTH arguments.  The SIZE argument specifies the number of bytes
     to be transmitted.

     The FLAGS are interpreted the same way as for 'send'; see *note
     Socket Data Options::.
