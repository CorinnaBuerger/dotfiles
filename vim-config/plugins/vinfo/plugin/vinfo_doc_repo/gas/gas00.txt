'@FILE'
     Read command-line options from FILE.  The options read are inserted
     in place of the original @FILE option.  If FILE does not exist, or
     cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
     removed.

     Options in FILE are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
     character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
     option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including
     a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be
     included with a backslash.  The FILE may itself contain additional
     @FILE options; any such options will be processed recursively.

'-a[cdghlmns]'
     Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

     '-ac'
          omit false conditionals

     '-ad'
          omit debugging directives

     '-ag'
          include general information, like as version and options
          passed

     '-ah'
          include high-level source

     '-al'
          include assembly

     '-am'
          include macro expansions

     '-an'
          omit forms processing

     '-as'
          include symbols

     '=file'
          set the name of the listing file

     You may combine these options; for example, use '-aln' for assembly
     listing without forms processing.  The '=file' option, if used,
     must be the last one.  By itself, '-a' defaults to '-ahls'.

'--alternate'
     Begin in alternate macro mode.  *Note '.altmacro': Altmacro.

'--compress-debug-sections'
     Compress DWARF debug sections using zlib with SHF_COMPRESSED from
     the ELF ABI. The resulting object file may not be compatible with
     older linkers and object file utilities.  Note if compression would
     make a given section _larger_ then it is not compressed.

'--compress-debug-sections=none'
'--compress-debug-sections=zlib'
'--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu'
'--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi'
     These options control how DWARF debug sections are compressed.
     '--compress-debug-sections=none' is equivalent to
     '--nocompress-debug-sections'.  '--compress-debug-sections=zlib'
     and '--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi' are equivalent to
     '--compress-debug-sections'.  '--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu'
     compresses DWARF debug sections using zlib.  The debug sections are
     renamed to begin with '.zdebug'.  Note if compression would make a
     given section _larger_ then it is not compressed nor renamed.

'--nocompress-debug-sections'
     Do not compress DWARF debug sections.  This is usually the default
     for all targets except the x86/x86_64, but a configure time option
     can be used to override this.

'-D'
     Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with
     calls to other assemblers.

'--debug-prefix-map OLD=NEW'
     When assembling files in directory 'OLD', record debugging
     information describing them as in 'NEW' instead.

'--defsym SYM=VALUE'
     Define the symbol SYM to be VALUE before assembling the input file.
     VALUE must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading '0x'
     indicates a hexadecimal value, and a leading '0' indicates an octal
     value.  The value of the symbol can be overridden inside a source
     file via the use of a '.set' pseudo-op.

'-f'
     "fast"--skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is
     compiler output).

'-g'
'--gen-debug'
     Generate debugging information for each assembler source line using
     whichever debug format is preferred by the target.  This currently
     means either STABS, ECOFF or DWARF2.

'--gstabs'
     Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line.  This
     may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle it.

'--gstabs+'
     Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line, with
     GNU extensions that probably only gdb can handle, and that could
     make other debuggers crash or refuse to read your program.  This
     may help debugging assembler code.  Currently the only GNU
     extension is the location of the current working directory at
     assembling time.

'--gdwarf-2'
     Generate DWARF2 debugging information for each assembler line.
     This may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle
     it.  Note--this option is only supported by some targets, not all
     of them.

'--gdwarf-sections'
     Instead of creating a .debug_line section, create a series of
     .debug_line.FOO sections where FOO is the name of the corresponding
     code section.  For example a code section called .TEXT.FUNC will
     have its dwarf line number information placed into a section called
     .DEBUG_LINE.TEXT.FUNC.  If the code section is just called .TEXT
     then debug line section will still be called just .DEBUG_LINE
     without any suffix.

'--size-check=error'
'--size-check=warning'
     Issue an error or warning for invalid ELF .size directive.

'--elf-stt-common=no'
'--elf-stt-common=yes'
     These options control whether the ELF assembler should generate
     common symbols with the 'STT_COMMON' type.  The default can be
     controlled by a configure option '--enable-elf-stt-common'.

'--generate-missing-build-notes=yes'
'--generate-missing-build-notes=no'
     These options control whether the ELF assembler should generate GNU
     Build attribute notes if none are present in the input sources.
     The default can be controlled by the
     '--enable-generate-build-notes' configure option.

'--help'
     Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

'--target-help'
     Print a summary of all target specific options and exit.

'-I DIR'
     Add directory DIR to the search list for '.include' directives.

'-J'
     Don't warn about signed overflow.

'-K'
     Issue warnings when difference tables altered for long
     displacements.

'-L'
'--keep-locals'
     Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols.  These symbols start with
     system-specific local label prefixes, typically '.L' for ELF
     systems or 'L' for traditional a.out systems.  *Note Symbol
     Names::.

'--listing-lhs-width=NUMBER'
     Set the maximum width, in words, of the output data column for an
     assembler listing to NUMBER.

     line of input to NUMBER + 1.

'--no-pad-sections'
     Stop the assembler for padding the ends of output sections to the
     alignment of that section.  The default is to pad the sections, but
     this can waste space which might be needed on targets which have
     tight memory constraints.

'-o OBJFILE'
     Name the object-file output from 'as' OBJFILE.

'-R'
     Fold the data section into the text section.

'--hash-size=NUMBER'
     Set the default size of GAS's hash tables to a prime number close
     to NUMBER.  Increasing this value can reduce the length of time it
     takes the assembler to perform its tasks, at the expense of
     increasing the assembler's memory requirements.  Similarly reducing
     this value can reduce the memory requirements at the expense of
     speed.

'--reduce-memory-overheads'
     This option reduces GAS's memory requirements, at the expense of
     making the assembly processes slower.  Currently this switch is a
     synonym for '--hash-size=4051', but in the future it may have other
     effects as well.

'--sectname-subst'
     Honor substitution sequences in section names.  *Note '.section
     NAME': Section Name Substitutions.

     The target machine does (or does not) have a floating-point
     coprocessor.  The default is to assume a coprocessor for 68020,
     68030, and cpu32.  Although the basic 68000 is not compatible with
     the 68881, a combination of the two can be specified, since it's
     possible to do emulation of the coprocessor instructions with the
     main processor.

SPARC architecture:

'-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite'
'-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av9 | -Av9a'
     Explicitly select a variant of the SPARC architecture.

     '-Av8plus' and '-Av8plusa' select a 32 bit environment.  '-Av9' and
     '-Av9a' select a 64 bit environment.

     '-Av8plusa' and '-Av9a' enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
     UltraSPARC extensions.

     Redirect error output to a file, for broken systems which don't
     support such behaviour in the shell.

   The following options are available when as is configured for a MIPS
processor.

'-G NUM'
     This option sets the largest size of an object that can be
     referenced implicitly with the 'gp' register.  It is only accepted
     for targets that use ECOFF format, such as a DECstation running
     Ultrix.  The default value is 8.

     Cause stabs-style debugging output to go into an ECOFF-style
     .mdebug section instead of the standard ELF .stabs sections.

'-mpdr'
'-mno-pdr'
     Control generation of '.pdr' sections.

'-mgp32'
'-mfp32'
     The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but
     these flags force a certain group of registers to be treated as 32
     bits wide at all times.  '-mgp32' controls the size of
     general-purpose registers and '-mfp32' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

'-mgp64'
'-mfp64'
     The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but
     these flags force a certain group of registers to be treated as 64
     bits wide at all times.  '-mgp64' controls the size of
     general-purpose registers and '-mfp64' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

'-mfpxx'
     The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA and ABI, but
     using this flag in combination with '-mabi=32' enables an ABI
     variant which will operate correctly with floating-point registers
     which are 32 or 64 bits wide.

'-modd-spreg'
'-mno-odd-spreg'
     Enable use of floating-point operations on odd-numbered
     single-precision registers when supported by the ISA. '-mfpxx'
     implies '-mno-odd-spreg', otherwise the default is '-modd-spreg'.

'-mips16'
'-no-mips16'
     Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting '.module mips16' at the start of the assembly file.
     '-no-mips16' turns off this option.

'-mmips16e2'
'-mno-mips16e2'
     Enable the use of MIPS16e2 instructions in MIPS16 mode.  This is
     equivalent to putting '.module mips16e2' at the start of the
     assembly file.  '-mno-mips16e2' turns off this option.

'-mmicromips'
'-mno-micromips'
     Generate code for the microMIPS processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting '.module micromips' at the start of the assembly file.
     '-mno-micromips' turns off this option.  This is equivalent to
     putting '.module nomicromips' at the start of the assembly file.

'-msmartmips'
'-mno-smartmips'
     Enables the SmartMIPS extension to the MIPS32 instruction set.
     This is equivalent to putting '.module smartmips' at the start of
     the assembly file.  '-mno-smartmips' turns off this option.

'-mips3d'
'-no-mips3d'
     Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.  '-no-mips3d'
     turns off this option.

'-mdmx'
'-no-mdmx'
     Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  '-no-mdmx' turns
     off this option.

'-mdsp'
'-mno-dsp'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 1 Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept DSP Release 1 instructions.
     '-mno-dsp' turns off this option.

'-mdspr2'
'-mno-dspr2'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 2 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies '-mdsp'.  This tells the assembler to accept
     DSP Release 2 instructions.  '-mno-dspr2' turns off this option.

'-mdspr3'
'-mno-dspr3'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 3 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies '-mdsp' and '-mdspr2'.  This tells the
     assembler to accept DSP Release 3 instructions.  '-mno-dspr3' turns
     off this option.

'-mmsa'
'-mno-msa'
     Generate code for the MIPS SIMD Architecture Extension.  This tells
     the assembler to accept MSA instructions.  '-mno-msa' turns off
     this option.

'-mxpa'
'-mno-xpa'
     Generate code for the MIPS eXtended Physical Address (XPA)
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept XPA instructions.
     '-mno-xpa' turns off this option.

'-mmt'
'-mno-mt'
     Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MT instructions.  '-mno-mt' turns off
     this option.

'-mmcu'
'-mno-mcu'
     Generate code for the MCU Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MCU instructions.  '-mno-mcu' turns
     off this option.

'-mcrc'
'-mno-crc'
     Generate code for the MIPS cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
     Application Specific Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept
     CRC instructions.  '-mno-crc' turns off this option.

'-mginv'
'-mno-ginv'
     Generate code for the Global INValidate (GINV) Application Specific
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept GINV instructions.
     '-mno-ginv' turns off this option.

'-minsn32'
'-mno-insn32'
     Only use 32-bit instruction encodings when generating code for the
     microMIPS processor.  This option inhibits the use of any 16-bit
     instructions.  This is equivalent to putting '.set insn32' at the
     start of the assembly file.  '-mno-insn32' turns off this option.
     This is equivalent to putting '.set noinsn32' at the start of the
     assembly file.  By default '-mno-insn32' is selected, allowing all
     instructions to be used.

'--construct-floats'
'--no-construct-floats'
     The '--no-construct-floats' option disables the construction of
     double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of
     the value into the two single width floating point registers that
     make up the double width register.  By default '--construct-floats'
     is selected, allowing construction of these floating point
     constants.

'--relax-branch'
'--no-relax-branch'
     The '--relax-branch' option enables the relaxation of out-of-range
     branches.  By default '--no-relax-branch' is selected, causing any
     out-of-range branches to produce an error.

'-mignore-branch-isa'
'-mno-ignore-branch-isa'
     Ignore branch checks for invalid transitions between ISA modes.
     The semantics of branches does not provide for an ISA mode switch,
     so in most cases the ISA mode a branch has been encoded for has to
     be the same as the ISA mode of the branch's target label.
     Therefore GAS has checks implemented that verify in branch assembly
     that the two ISA modes match.  '-mignore-branch-isa' disables these
     checks.  By default '-mno-ignore-branch-isa' is selected, causing
     any invalid branch requiring a transition between ISA modes to
     produce an error.

'-mnan=ENCODING'
     Select between the IEEE 754-2008 ('-mnan=2008') or the legacy
     ('-mnan=legacy') NaN encoding format.  The latter is the default.

'--emulation=NAME'
     This option was formerly used to switch between ELF and ECOFF
     output on targets like IRIX 5 that supported both.  MIPS ECOFF
     support was removed in GAS 2.24, so the option now serves little
     purpose.  It is retained for backwards compatibility.

     The available configuration names are: 'mipself', 'mipslelf' and
     'mipsbelf'.  Choosing 'mipself' now has no effect, since the output
     is always ELF. 'mipslelf' and 'mipsbelf' select little- and
     big-endian output respectively, but '-EL' and '-EB' are now the
     preferred options instead.

'-nocpp'
     'as' ignores this option.  It is accepted for compatibility with
     the native tools.

'--trap'
'--no-trap'
'--break'
'--no-break'
     Control how to deal with multiplication overflow and division by
     zero.  '--trap' or '--no-break' (which are synonyms) take a trap
     exception (and only work for Instruction Set Architecture level 2
     and higher); '--break' or '--no-trap' (also synonyms, and the
     default) take a break exception.

'-n'
     When this option is used, 'as' will issue a warning every time it
     generates a nop instruction from a macro.

   The following options are available when as is configured for an
MCore processor.

'-jsri2bsr'
'-nojsri2bsr'
     Enable or disable the JSRI to BSR transformation.  By default this
     is enabled.  The command line option '-nojsri2bsr' can be used to
     disable it.

'-sifilter'
'-nosifilter'
     Enable or disable the silicon filter behaviour.  By default this is
     disabled.  The default can be overridden by the '-sifilter' command
     line option.

'-relax'
     Alter jump instructions for long displacements.

'-mcpu=[210|340]'
     Select the cpu type on the target hardware.  This controls which
     instructions can be assembled.

'-EB'
     Assemble for a big endian target.

'-EL'
     Assemble for a little endian target.

1.1 Structure of this Manual
----------------------------

This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use GNU
'as'.  We cover the syntax expected in source files, including notation
for symbols, constants, and expressions; the directives that 'as'
understands; and of course how to invoke 'as'.

   This manual also describes some of the machine-dependent features of
various flavors of the assembler.

   On the other hand, this manual is _not_ intended as an introduction
to programming in assembly language--let alone programming in general!
In a similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine
architecture; we do _not_ describe the instruction set, standard
mnemonics, registers or addressing modes that are standard to a
particular architecture.  You may want to consult the manufacturer's
machine architecture manual for this information.

1.2 The GNU Assembler
---------------------

GNU 'as' is really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have used)
the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar
environment when you use it on another architecture.  Each version has
much in common with the others, including object file formats, most
assembler directives (often called "pseudo-ops") and assembler syntax.

   'as' is primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C
compiler 'gcc' for use by the linker 'ld'.  Nevertheless, we've tried to
make 'as' assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the
same machine would assemble.  Any exceptions are documented explicitly
(*note Machine Dependencies::).  This doesn't mean 'as' always uses the
same syntax as another assembler for the same architecture; for example,
we know of several incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language
syntax.

   Unlike older assemblers, 'as' is designed to assemble a source
program in one pass of the source file.  This has a subtle impact on the
'.org' directive (*note '.org': Org.).

1.3 Object File Formats
-----------------------

The GNU assembler can be configured to produce several alternative
object file formats.  For the most part, this does not affect how you
write assembly language programs; but directives for debugging symbols
are typically different in different file formats.  *Note Symbol
Attributes: Symbol Attributes.

1.4 Command Line
----------------

After the program name 'as', the command line may contain options and
file names.  Options may appear in any order, and may be before, after,
or between file names.  The order of file names is significant.

   '--' (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
explicitly, as one of the files for 'as' to assemble.

   Except for '--' any command line argument that begins with a hyphen
('-') is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of 'as'.  No
option changes the way another option works.  An option is a '-'
followed by one or more letters; the case of the letter is important.
All options are optional.

   Some options expect exactly one file name to follow them.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible with
older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU standard).
These two command lines are equivalent:

     as -o my-object-file.o mumble.s
     as -omy-object-file.o mumble.s

1.5 Input Files
---------------

We use the phrase "source program", abbreviated "source", to describe
the program input to one run of 'as'.  The program may be in one or more
files; how the source is partitioned into files doesn't change the
meaning of the source.

   The source program is a concatenation of the text in all the files,
in the order specified.

   Each time you run 'as' it assembles exactly one source program.  The
source program is made up of one or more files.  (The standard input is
also a file.)

   You give 'as' a command line that has zero or more input file names.
The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A command line
argument (in any position) that has no special meaning is taken to be an
input file name.

   If you give 'as' no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the 'as' standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You may
have to type <ctl-D> to tell 'as' there is no more program to assemble.

   Use '--' if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in
your command line.

   If the source is empty, 'as' produces a small, empty object file.

Filenames and Line-numbers
--------------------------

There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files) and
either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to a
line number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
"logical" file.  *Note Error and Warning Messages: Errors.

   "Physical files" are those files named in the command line given to
'as'.

   "Logical files" are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file names
help error messages reflect the original source file, when 'as' source
is itself synthesized from other files.  'as' understands the '#'
directives emitted by the 'gcc' preprocessor.  See also *note '.file':
File.

1.6 Output (Object) File
------------------------

Every time you run 'as' it produces an output file, which is your
assembly language program translated into numbers.  This file is the
object file.  Its default name is 'a.out'.  You can give it another name
by using the '-o' option.  Conventionally, object file names end with
'.o'.  The default name is used for historical reasons: older assemblers
were capable of assembling self-contained programs directly into a
runnable program.  (For some formats, this isn't currently possible, but
it can be done for the 'a.out' format.)

   The object file is meant for input to the linker 'ld'.  It contains
assembled program code, information to help 'ld' integrate the assembled
program into a runnable file, and (optionally) symbolic information for
the debugger.

1.7 Error and Warning Messages
------------------------------

'as' may write warnings and error messages to the standard error file
(usually your terminal).  This should not happen when a compiler runs
'as' automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so that 'as'
could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem
that stops the assembly.

   Warning messages have the format

     file_name:NNN:Warning Message Text

(where NNN is a line number).  If both a logical file name (*note
'.file': File.) and a logical line number (*note '.line': Line.) have
been given then they will be used, otherwise the file name and line
number in the current assembler source file will be used.  The message
text is intended to be self explanatory (in the grand Unix tradition).

   Note the file name must be set via the logical version of the '.file'
directive, not the DWARF2 version of the '.file' directive.  For
example:

       .file 2 "bar.c"
          error_assembler_source
       .file "foo.c"
       .line 30
           error_c_source

   produces this output:

       Assembler messages:
       asm.s:2: Error: no such instruction: `error_assembler_source'
       foo.c:31: Error: no such instruction: `error_c_source'

   Error messages have the format

     file_name:NNN:FATAL:Error Message Text

   The file name and line number are derived as for warning messages.
The actual message text may be rather less explanatory because many of
them aren't supposed to happen.

2 Command-Line Options
======================

This chapter describes command-line options available in _all_ versions
of the GNU assembler; see *note Machine Dependencies::, for options
specific to particular machine architectures.

   If you are invoking 'as' via the GNU C compiler, you can use the
'-Wa' option to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The assembler
arguments must be separated from each other (and the '-Wa') by commas.
For example:

     gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c

This passes two options to the assembler: '-alh' (emit a listing to
standard output with high-level and assembly source) and '-L' (retain
local symbols in the symbol table).

   Usually you do not need to use this '-Wa' mechanism, since many
compiler command-line options are automatically passed to the assembler
by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver with the '-v'
option to see precisely what options it passes to each compilation pass,
including the assembler.)

2.1 Enable Listings: '-a[cdghlns]'
----------------------------------

These options enable listing output from the assembler.  By itself, '-a'
requests high-level, assembly, and symbols listing.  You can use other
letters to select specific options for the list: '-ah' requests a
high-level language listing, '-al' requests an output-program assembly
listing, and '-as' requests a symbol table listing.  High-level listings
require that a compiler debugging option like '-g' be used, and that
assembly listings ('-al') be requested also.

   Use the '-ag' option to print a first section with general assembly
information, like as version, switches passed, or time stamp.

   Use the '-ac' option to omit false conditionals from a listing.  Any
lines which are not assembled because of a false '.if' (or '.ifdef', or
any other conditional), or a true '.if' followed by an '.else', will be
omitted from the listing.

   Use the '-ad' option to omit debugging directives from the listing.

   Once you have specified one of these options, you can further control
listing output and its appearance using the directives '.list',
'.nolist', '.psize', '.eject', '.title', and '.sbttl'.  The '-an' option
turns off all forms processing.  If you do not request listing output
with one of the '-a' options, the listing-control directives have no
effect.

   The letters after '-a' may be combined into one option, _e.g._,
'-aln'.

   Note if the assembler source is coming from the standard input (e.g.,
because it is being created by 'gcc' and the '-pipe' command line switch
is being used) then the listing will not contain any comments or
preprocessor directives.  This is because the listing code buffers input
source lines from stdin only after they have been preprocessed by the
assembler.  This reduces memory usage and makes the code more efficient.

2.3 '-D'

2.4 Work Faster: '-f'
---------------------

'-f' should only be used when assembling programs written by a (trusted)
compiler.  '-f' stops the assembler from doing whitespace and comment
preprocessing on the input file(s) before assembling them.  *Note
Preprocessing: Preprocessing.

     _Warning:_ if you use '-f' when the files actually need to be
     preprocessed (if they contain comments, for example), 'as' does not
     work correctly.

2.5 '.include' Search Path: '-I' PATH
-------------------------------------

Use this option to add a PATH to the list of directories 'as' searches
for files specified in '.include' directives (*note '.include':
Include.).  You may use '-I' as many times as necessary to include a
variety of paths.  The current working directory is always searched
first; after that, 'as' searches any '-I' directories in the same order
as they were specified (left to right) on the command line.

2.6 Difference Tables: '-K'
---------------------------

'as' sometimes alters the code emitted for directives of the form '.word
SYM1-SYM2'.  *Note '.word': Word.  You can use the '-K' option if you
want a warning issued when this is done.

2.7 Include Local Symbols: '-L'
-------------------------------

Symbols beginning with system-specific local label prefixes, typically
'.L' for ELF systems or 'L' for traditional a.out systems, are called
"local symbols".  *Note Symbol Names::.  Normally you do not see such
symbols when debugging, because they are intended for the use of
programs (like compilers) that compose assembler programs, not for your
notice.  Normally both 'as' and 'ld' discard such symbols, so you do not
normally debug with them.

   This option tells 'as' to retain those local symbols in the object
file.  Usually if you do this you also tell the linker 'ld' to preserve
those symbols.

2.8 Configuring listing output: '--listing'
-------------------------------------------

The listing feature of the assembler can be enabled via the command line
switch '-a' (*note a::).  This feature combines the input source file(s)
with a hex dump of the corresponding locations in the output object
file, and displays them as a listing file.  The format of this listing
can be controlled by directives inside the assembler source (i.e.,
'.list' (*note List::), '.title' (*note Title::), '.sbttl' (*note
Sbttl::), '.psize' (*note Psize::), and '.eject' (*note Eject::) and
also by the following switches:

'--listing-lhs-width='number''
     Sets the maximum width, in words, of the first line of the hex byte
     dump.  This dump appears on the left hand side of the listing
     output.

'--listing-lhs-width2='number''
     Sets the maximum width, in words, of any further lines of the hex
     byte dump for a given input source line.  If this value is not
     specified, it defaults to being the same as the value specified for
     '--listing-lhs-width'.  If neither switch is used the default is to
     one.

'--listing-rhs-width='number''
     Sets the maximum width, in characters, of the source line that is
     displayed alongside the hex dump.  The default value for this
     parameter is 100.  The source line is displayed on the right hand
     side of the listing output.

'--listing-cont-lines='number''
     Sets the maximum number of continuation lines of hex dump that will
     be displayed for a given single line of source input.  The default
     value is 4.

2.9 Assemble in MRI Compatibility Mode: '-M'
--------------------------------------------

The '-M' or '--mri' option selects MRI compatibility mode.  This changes
the syntax and pseudo-op handling of 'as' to make it compatible with the
'ASM68K' assembler from Microtec Research.  The exact nature of the MRI
syntax will not be documented here; see the MRI manuals for more
information.  Note in particular that the handling of macros and macro
arguments is somewhat different.  The purpose of this option is to
permit assembling existing MRI assembler code using 'as'.

   The MRI compatibility is not complete.  Certain operations of the MRI
assembler depend upon its object file format, and can not be supported
using other object file formats.  Supporting these would require
enhancing each object file format individually.  These are:

   * global symbols in common section

     The m68k MRI assembler supports common sections which are merged by
     the linker.  Other object file formats do not support this.  'as'
     handles common sections by treating them as a single common symbol.
     It permits local symbols to be defined within a common section, but
     it can not support global symbols, since it has no way to describe
     them.

   * complex relocations

     The MRI assemblers support relocations against a negated section
     address, and relocations which combine the start addresses of two
     or more sections.  These are not support by other object file
     formats.

   * 'END' pseudo-op specifying start address

     The MRI 'END' pseudo-op permits the specification of a start
     address.  This is not supported by other object file formats.  The
     start address may instead be specified using the '-e' option to the
     linker, or in a linker script.

   * 'IDNT', '.ident' and 'NAME' pseudo-ops

     The MRI 'IDNT', '.ident' and 'NAME' pseudo-ops assign a module name
     to the output file.  This is not supported by other object file
     formats.

   * 'ORG' pseudo-op

     The m68k MRI 'ORG' pseudo-op begins an absolute section at a given
     address.  This differs from the usual 'as' '.org' pseudo-op, which
     changes the location within the current section.  Absolute sections
     are not supported by other object file formats.  The address of a
     section may be assigned within a linker script.

   There are some other features of the MRI assembler which are not
supported by 'as', typically either because they are difficult or
because they seem of little consequence.  Some of these may be supported
in future releases.

   * EBCDIC strings

     EBCDIC strings are not supported.

   * packed binary coded decimal

     Packed binary coded decimal is not supported.  This means that the
     'DC.P' and 'DCB.P' pseudo-ops are not supported.

   * 'FEQU' pseudo-op

     The m68k 'FEQU' pseudo-op is not supported.

   * 'NOOBJ' pseudo-op

     The m68k 'NOOBJ' pseudo-op is not supported.

   * 'OPT' branch control options

     The m68k 'OPT' branch control options--'B', 'BRS', 'BRB', 'BRL',
     and 'BRW'--are ignored.  'as' automatically relaxes all branches,
     whether forward or backward, to an appropriate size, so these
     options serve no purpose.

   * 'OPT' list control options

     The following m68k 'OPT' list control options are ignored: 'C',
     'CEX', 'CL', 'CRE', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'M', 'MEX', 'MC', 'MD', 'X'.

   * other 'OPT' options

     The following m68k 'OPT' options are ignored: 'NEST', 'O', 'OLD',
     'OP', 'P', 'PCO', 'PCR', 'PCS', 'R'.

   * 'OPT' 'D' option is default

     The m68k 'OPT' 'D' option is the default, unlike the MRI assembler.
     'OPT NOD' may be used to turn it off.

   * 'XREF' pseudo-op.

     The m68k 'XREF' pseudo-op is ignored.

2.10 Dependency Tracking: '--MD'
--------------------------------

'as' can generate a dependency file for the file it creates.  This file
consists of a single rule suitable for 'make' describing the
dependencies of the main source file.

   The rule is written to the file named in its argument.

   This feature is used in the automatic updating of makefiles.

2.11 Output Section Padding
---------------------------

Normally the assembler will pad the end of each output section up to its
alignment boundary.  But this can waste space, which can be significant
on memory constrained targets.  So the '--no-pad-sections' option will
disable this behaviour.

2.12 Name the Object File: '-o'
-------------------------------

There is always one object file output when you run 'as'.  By default it
has the name 'a.out'.  You use this option (which takes exactly one
filename) to give the object file a different name.

   Whatever the object file is called, 'as' overwrites any existing file
of the same name.

2.13 Join Data and Text Sections: '-R'
--------------------------------------

'-R' tells 'as' to write the object file as if all data-section data
lives in the text section.  This is only done at the very last moment:
your binary data are the same, but data section parts are relocated
differently.  The data section part of your object file is zero bytes
long because all its bytes are appended to the text section.  (*Note
Sections and Relocation: Sections.)

   When you specify '-R' it would be possible to generate shorter
address displacements (because we do not have to cross between text and
data section).  We refrain from doing this simply for compatibility with
older versions of 'as'.  In future, '-R' may work this way.

   When 'as' is configured for COFF or ELF output, this option is only
useful if you use sections named '.text' and '.data'.

   '-R' is not supported for any of the HPPA targets.  Using '-R'
generates a warning from 'as'.

2.14 Display Assembly Statistics: '--statistics'
------------------------------------------------

Use '--statistics' to display two statistics about the resources used by
'as': the maximum amount of space allocated during the assembly (in
bytes), and the total execution time taken for the assembly (in CPU
seconds).

2.15 Compatible Output: '--traditional-format'
----------------------------------------------

For some targets, the output of 'as' is different in some ways from the
output of some existing assembler.  This switch requests 'as' to use the
traditional format instead.

   For example, it disables the exception frame optimizations which 'as'
normally does by default on 'gcc' output.

2.17 Control Warnings: '-W', '--warn', '--no-warn', '--fatal-warnings'
----------------------------------------------------------------------

'as' should never give a warning or error message when assembling
compiler output.  But programs written by people often cause 'as' to
give a warning that a particular assumption was made.  All such warnings
are directed to the standard error file.

   If you use the '-W' and '--no-warn' options, no warnings are issued.
This only affects the warning messages: it does not change any
particular of how 'as' assembles your file.  Errors, which stop the
assembly, are still reported.

   If you use the '--fatal-warnings' option, 'as' considers files that
generate warnings to be in error.

   You can switch these options off again by specifying '--warn', which
causes warnings to be output as usual.

2.18 Generate Object File in Spite of Errors: '-Z'
--------------------------------------------------

After an error message, 'as' normally produces no output.  If for some
reason you are interested in object file output even after 'as' gives an
error message on your program, use the '-Z' option.  If there are any
errors, 'as' continues anyways, and writes an object file after a final
warning message of the form 'N errors, M warnings, generating bad object
file.'

3 Syntax
========

This chapter describes the machine-independent syntax allowed in a
source file.  'as' syntax is similar to what many other assemblers use;
it is inspired by the BSD 4.2 assembler, except that 'as' does not
assemble Vax bit-fields.

3.1 Preprocessing
-----------------

The 'as' internal preprocessor:
   * adjusts and removes extra whitespace.  It leaves one space or tab
     before the keywords on a line, and turns any other whitespace on
     the line into a single space.

   * removes all comments, replacing them with a single space, or an
     appropriate number of newlines.

   * converts character constants into the appropriate numeric values.

   It does not do macro processing, include file handling, or anything
else you may get from your C compiler's preprocessor.  You can do
include file processing with the '.include' directive (*note '.include':
Include.).  You can use the GNU C compiler driver to get other "CPP"
style preprocessing by giving the input file a '.S' suffix.  *Note
Options Controlling the Kind of Output: (gcc info)Overall Options.

   Excess whitespace, comments, and character constants cannot be used
in the portions of the input text that are not preprocessed.

   If the first line of an input file is '#NO_APP' or if you use the
'-f' option, whitespace and comments are not removed from the input
file.  Within an input file, you can ask for whitespace and comment
removal in specific portions of the by putting a line that says '#APP'
before the text that may contain whitespace or comments, and putting a
line that says '#NO_APP' after this text.  This feature is mainly intend
to support 'asm' statements in compilers whose output is otherwise free
of comments and whitespace.

"Whitespace" is one or more blanks or tabs, in any order.  Whitespace is
used to separate symbols, and to make programs neater for people to
read.  Unless within character constants (*note Character Constants:
Characters.), any whitespace means the same as exactly one space.

3.3 Comments
------------

There are two ways of rendering comments to 'as'.  In both cases the
comment is equivalent to one space.

   Anything from '/*' through the next '*/' is a comment.  This means
you may not nest these comments.

     /*
       The only way to include a newline ('\n') in a comment
       is to use this sort of comment.
     */

     /* This sort of comment does not nest. */

   Anything from a "line comment" character up to the next newline is
considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is
target specific, and some targets multiple comment characters.  Some
targets also have line comment characters that only work if they are the
first character on a line.  Some targets use a sequence of two
characters to introduce a line comment.  Some targets can also change
their line comment characters depending upon command line options that
have been used.  For more details see the _Syntax_ section in the
documentation for individual targets.

   If the line comment character is the hash sign ('#') then it still
has the special ability to enable and disable preprocessing (*note
Preprocessing::) and to specify logical line numbers:

   To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with '#' have
a special interpretation.  Following the '#' should be an absolute
expression (*note Expressions::): the logical line number of the _next_
line.  Then a string (*note Strings: Strings.) is allowed: if present it
is a new logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be
whitespace.

   If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)

                               # This is an ordinary comment.
     # 42-6 "new_file_name"    # New logical file name
                               # This is logical line # 36.
   This feature is deprecated, and may disappear from future versions of
'as'.

3.4 Symbols
-----------

A "symbol" is one or more characters chosen from the set of all letters
(both upper and lower case), digits and the three characters '_.$'.  On
most machines, you can also use '$' in symbol names; exceptions are
noted in *note Machine Dependencies::.  No symbol may begin with a
digit.  Case is significant.  There is no length limit; all characters
are significant.  Multibyte characters are supported.  Symbols are
delimited by characters not in that set, or by the beginning of a file
(since the source program must end with a newline, the end of a file is
not a possible symbol delimiter).  *Note Symbols::.

   Symbol names may also be enclosed in double quote '"' characters.  In
such cases any characters are allowed, except for the NUL character.  If
a double quote character is to be included in the symbol name it must be
preceeded by a backslash '\' character.

3.5 Statements
--------------

A "statement" ends at a newline character ('\n') or a "line separator
character".  The line separator character is target specific and
described in the _Syntax_ section of each target's documentation.  Not
all targets support a line separator character.  The newline or line
separator character is considered to be part of the preceding statement.
Newlines and separators within character constants are an exception:
they do not end statements.

   It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file: the last
character of any input file should be a newline.

   An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is
ignored.

   A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot '.' then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language "instruction": it
assembles into a machine language instruction.  Different versions of
'as' for different computers recognize different instructions.  In fact,
the same symbol may represent a different instruction in a different
computer's assembly language.

   A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (':').
Whitespace before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not
have whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon.  *Note Labels::.

   For HPPA targets, labels need not be immediately followed by a colon,
but the definition of a label must begin in column zero.  This also
implies that only one label may be defined on each line.

     label:     .directive    followed by something
     another_label:           # This is an empty statement.
                instruction   operand_1, operand_2, ...

3.6 Constants
-------------

A constant is a number, written so that its value is known by
inspection, without knowing any context.  Like this:
     .byte  74, 0112, 092, 0x4A, 0X4a, 'J, '\J # All the same value.
     .ascii "Ring the bell\7"                  # A string constant.
     .octa  0x123456789abcdef0123456789ABCDEF0 # A bignum.
     .float 0f-314159265358979323846264338327\
     95028841971.693993751E-40                 # - pi, a flonum.

3.6.1 Character Constants
-------------------------

There are two kinds of character constants.  A "character" stands for
one character in one byte and its value may be used in numeric
expressions.  String constants (properly called string _literals_) are
potentially many bytes and their values may not be used in arithmetic
expressions.

3.6.1.1 Strings
---------------

A "string" is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to "escape" these characters: precede them with a
backslash '\' character.  For example '\\' represents one backslash: the
first '\' is an escape which tells 'as' to interpret the second
character literally as a backslash (which prevents 'as' from recognizing
the second '\' as an escape character).  The complete list of escapes
follows.

'\b'
     Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.

'backslash-f'
     Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.

'\n'
     Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.

'\r'
     Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.

'\t'
     Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.

'\ DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT'
     An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.  For
     compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as
     digits: for example, '\008' has the value 010, and '\009' the value
     011.

'\x HEX-DIGITS...'
     A hex character code.  All trailing hex digits are combined.
     Either upper or lower case 'x' works.

'\\'
     Represents one '\' character.

'\"'
     Represents one '"' character.  Needed in strings to represent this
     character, because an unescaped '"' would end the string.

'\ ANYTHING-ELSE'
     Any other character when escaped by '\' gives a warning, but
     assembles as if the '\' was not present.  The idea is that if you
     used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
     interpretation of the following character.  However 'as' has no
     other interpretation, so 'as' knows it is giving you the wrong code
     and warns you of the fact.

   Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think the
BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C compilers
recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape sequence.

3.6.1.2 Characters
------------------

A single character may be written as a single quote immediately followed
by that character.  Some backslash escapes apply to characters, '\b',
'\f', '\n', '\r', '\t', and '\"' with the same meaning as for strings,
plus '\'' for a single quote.  So if you want to write the character
backslash, you must write ''\\' where the first '\' escapes the second
'\'.  As you can see, the quote is an acute accent, not a grave accent.
A newline immediately following an acute accent is taken as a literal
character and does not count as the end of a statement.  The value of a
character constant in a numeric expression is the machine's byte-wide
code for that character.  'as' assumes your character code is ASCII:
''A' means 65, ''B' means 66, and so on.

3.6.2 Number Constants
----------------------

'as' distinguishes three kinds of numbers according to how they are
stored in the target machine.  _Integers_ are numbers that would fit
into an 'int' in the C language.  _Bignums_ are integers, but they are
stored in more than 32 bits.  _Flonums_ are floating point numbers,
described below.

3.6.2.1 Integers
----------------

A binary integer is '0b' or '0B' followed by zero or more of the binary
digits '01'.

   An octal integer is '0' followed by zero or more of the octal digits
('01234567').

   A decimal integer starts with a non-zero digit followed by zero or
more digits ('0123456789').

   A hexadecimal integer is '0x' or '0X' followed by one or more
hexadecimal digits chosen from '0123456789abcdefABCDEF'.

   Integers have the usual values.  To denote a negative integer, use
the prefix operator '-' discussed under expressions (*note Prefix
Operators: Prefix Ops.).

3.6.2.2 Bignums
---------------

A "bignum" has the same syntax and semantics as an integer except that
the number (or its negative) takes more than 32 bits to represent in
binary.  The distinction is made because in some places integers are
permitted while bignums are not.

3.6.2.3 Flonums
---------------

A "flonum" represents a floating point number.  The translation is
indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
'as' to a generic binary floating point number of more than sufficient
precision.  This generic floating point number is converted to a
particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a portion of
'as' specialized to that computer.

   A flonum is written by writing (in order)
   * The digit '0'.  ('0' is optional on the HPPA.)

   * A letter, to tell 'as' the rest of the number is a flonum.  'e' is
     recommended.  Case is not important.

     On the H8/300 and Renesas / SuperH SH architectures, the letter
     must be one of the letters 'DFPRSX' (in upper or lower case).

     On the ARC, the letter must be one of the letters 'DFRS' (in upper
     or lower case).

     On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be 'E' (upper case only).

   * An optional sign: either '+' or '-'.

   * An optional "integer part": zero or more decimal digits.

   * An optional "fractional part": '.' followed by zero or more decimal
     digits.

   * An optional exponent, consisting of:

        * An 'E' or 'e'.
        * Optional sign: either '+' or '-'.
        * One or more decimal digits.

   At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

   'as' does all processing using integers.  Flonums are computed
independently of any floating point hardware in the computer running
'as'.

4.1 Background
--------------

Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data "in"
those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.  For
example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker 'ld' reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When 'as' emits an
object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.  'ld'
assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that different
partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how 'as' uses sections.

   'ld' moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a _section_.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called "relocation".  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to the
proper run-time addresses.  For the H8/300, and for the Renesas / SuperH
SH, 'as' pads sections if needed to ensure they end on a word (sixteen
bit) boundary.

   An object file written by 'as' has at least three sections, any of
which may be empty.  These are named "text", "data" and "bss" sections.

   When it generates COFF or ELF output, 'as' can also generate whatever
other named sections you specify using the '.section' directive (*note
'.section': Section.).  If you do not use any directives that place
output in the '.text' or '.data' sections, these sections still exist,
but are empty.

   When 'as' generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA, 'as' can also
generate whatever other named sections you specify using the '.space'
and '.subspace' directives.  See 'HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for details on the '.space' and
'.subspace' assembler directives.

   Additionally, 'as' uses different names for the standard text, data,
and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text is placed
into the '$CODE$' section, data into '$DATA$', and BSS into '$BSS$'.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address '0', the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address '0', the data section at address '0x4000000',
and the bss section follows the data section.

   To let 'ld' know which data changes when the sections are relocated,
and how to change that data, 'as' also writes to the object file details
of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation 'ld' must know, each
time an address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?
   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?
   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric value
     of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?
   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address 'as' ever uses is expressed as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)
Further, most expressions 'as' computes have this section-relative
nature.  (For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some
expressions are symbol-relative instead.)

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N into
section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
"absolute" section.  When 'ld' mixes partial programs, addresses in the
absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address '{absolute 0}'
is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by 'ld'.  Although the linker never
arranges two partial programs' data sections with overlapping addresses
after linking, _by definition_ their absolute sections must overlap.
Address '{absolute 239}' in one part of a program is always the same
address when the program is running as address '{absolute 239}' in any
other part of the program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the "undefined" section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section _undefined_.

   By analogy the word _section_ is used to describe groups of sections
in the linked program.  'ld' puts all partial programs' text sections in
contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is customary to refer to
the _text section_ of a program, meaning all the addresses of all
partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for data and bss sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by 'ld'; others are invented for use of
'as' and have no meaning except during assembly.

4.2 Linker Sections
-------------------

'ld' deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

*named sections*
*text section*
*data section*
     These sections hold your program.  'as' and 'ld' treat them as
     separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section
     is true of another.  When the program is running, however, it is
     customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The text section
     is often shared among processes: it contains instructions,
     constants and the like.  The data section of a running program is
     usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored in the
     data section.

*bss section*
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold uninitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

*absolute section*
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that 'ld'
     must not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of
     absolute addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not change during
     relocation.

*undefined section*
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects not
     in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  The
example uses the traditional section names '.text' and '.data'.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+

4.3 Assembler Internal Sections
-------------------------------

These sections are meant only for the internal use of 'as'.  They have
no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in 'as' warning
messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their meanings to
'as'.  These sections are used to permit the value of every expression
in your assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means there
     is a bug in the assembler.

expr section
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.

4.4 Sub-Sections
----------------

Assembled bytes conventionally fall into two sections: text and data.
You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want to
end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are not
contiguous in the assembler source.  'as' allows you to use
"subsections" for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled into
the same subsection go into the object file together with other objects
in the same subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to store
constants in the text section, but might not want to have them
interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this case, the
compiler could issue a '.text 0' before each section of code being
output, and a '.text 1' before each group of constants being output.

   Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors of
'as'.)

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.)  The object file contains no representation of subsections;
'ld' and other programs that manipulate object files see no trace of
them.  They just see all your text subsections as a text section, and
all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a '.text EXPRESSION' or a
'.data EXPRESSION' statement.  When generating COFF output, you can also
use an extra subsection argument with arbitrary named sections:
'.section NAME, EXPRESSION'.  When generating ELF output, you can also
use the '.subsection' directive (*note SubSection::) to specify a
subsection: '.subsection EXPRESSION'.  EXPRESSION should be an absolute
expression (*note Expressions::).  If you just say '.text' then '.text
0' is assumed.  Likewise '.data' means '.data 0'.  Assembly begins in
'text 0'.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a "location counter" incremented by one for every
byte assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to 'as' there is no concept of a subsection
location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location
counter--but the '.align' directive changes it, and any label definition
captures its current value.  The location counter of the section where
statements are being assembled is said to be the "active" location
counter.

4.5 bss Section
---------------

The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   The '.lcomm' pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see *note
'.lcomm': Lcomm.

   The '.comm' pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which
is another form of uninitialized symbol; see *note '.comm': Comm.

   When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such
as ELF or COFF, you may switch into the '.bss' section and define
symbols as usual; see *note '.section': Section.  You may only assemble
zero values into the section.  Typically the section will only contain
symbol definitions and '.skip' directives (*note '.skip': Skip.).

5 Symbols
=========

Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

     _Warning:_ 'as' does not place symbols in the object file in the
     same order they were declared.  This may break some debuggers.

5.1 Labels
----------

A "label" is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon ':'.
The symbol then represents the current value of the active location
counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.  You are
warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different locations:
the first definition overrides any other definitions.

   On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately
followed by a colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one
label may be defined on a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA
version of 'as' also provides a special directive '.label' for defining
labels more flexibly.

5.2 Giving Symbols Other Values
-------------------------------

A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol, followed
by an equals sign '=', followed by an expression (*note Expressions::).
This is equivalent to using the '.set' directive.  *Note '.set': Set.
In the same way, using a double equals sign '=''=' here represents an
equivalent of the '.eqv' directive.  *Note '.eqv': Eqv.

   Blackfin does not support symbol assignment with '='.

5.3 Symbol Names
----------------

Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of '._'.  On most machines,
you can also use '$' in symbol names; exceptions are noted in *note
Machine Dependencies::.  That character may be followed by any string of
digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted for a particular
target machine), and underscores.

   Case of letters is significant: 'foo' is a different symbol name than
'Foo'.

   Symbol names do not start with a digit.  An exception to this rule is
made for Local Labels.  See below.

   Multibyte characters are supported.  To generate a symbol name
containing multibyte characters enclose it within double quotes and use
escape codes.  cf *Note Strings::.  Generating a multibyte symbol name
from a label is not currently supported.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

A local symbol is any symbol beginning with certain local label
prefixes.  By default, the local label prefix is '.L' for ELF systems or
'L' for traditional a.out systems, but each target may have its own set
of local label prefixes.  On the HPPA local symbols begin with 'L$'.

   Local symbols are defined and used within the assembler, but they are
normally not saved in object files.  Thus, they are not visible when
debugging.  You may use the '-L' option (*note Include Local Symbols:
L.) to retain the local symbols in the object files.

Local Labels
------------

Local labels are different from local symbols.  Local labels help
compilers and programmers use names temporarily.  They create symbols
which are guaranteed to be unique over the entire scope of the input
source code and which can be referred to by a simple notation.  To
define a local label, write a label of the form 'N:' (where N represents
any non-negative integer).  To refer to the most recent previous
definition of that label write 'Nb', using the same number as when you
defined the label.  To refer to the next definition of a local label,
write 'Nf'.  The 'b' stands for "backwards" and the 'f' stands for
"forwards".

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, and you can
reuse them too.  So that it is possible to repeatedly define the same
local label (using the same number 'N'), although you can only refer to
the most recently defined local label of that number (for a backwards
reference) or the next definition of a specific local label for a
forward reference.  It is also worth noting that the first 10 local
labels ('0:'...'9:') are implemented in a slightly more efficient manner
than the others.

   Here is an example:

     1:        branch 1f
     2:        branch 1b
     1:        branch 2f
     2:        branch 1b

   Which is the equivalent of:

     label_1:  branch label_3
     label_2:  branch label_1
     label_3:  branch label_4
     label_4:  branch label_3

   Local label names are only a notational device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler
uses them.  The symbol names are stored in the symbol table, appear in
error messages, and are optionally emitted to the object file.  The
names are constructed using these parts:

'_local label prefix_'
     All local symbols begin with the system-specific local label
     prefix.  Normally both 'as' and 'ld' forget symbols that start with
     the local label prefix.  These labels are used for symbols you are
     never intended to see.  If you use the '-L' option then 'as'
     retains these symbols in the object file.  If you also instruct
     'ld' to retain these symbols, you may use them in debugging.

'NUMBER'
     This is the number that was used in the local label definition.  So
     if the label is written '55:' then the number is '55'.

'C-B'
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value of
     '\002' (control-B).

'_ordinal number_'
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
     definition of '0:' gets the number '1'.  The 15th definition of
     '0:' gets the number '15', and so on.  Likewise the first
     definition of '1:' gets the number '1' and its 15th definition gets
     '15' as well.

   So for example, the first '1:' may be named '.L1C-B1', and the 44th
'3:' may be named '.L3C-B44'.

Dollar Local Labels
-------------------

On some targets 'as' also supports an even more local form of local
labels called dollar labels.  These labels go out of scope (i.e., they
become undefined) as soon as a non-local label is defined.  Thus they
remain valid for only a small region of the input source code.  Normal
local labels, by contrast, remain in scope for the entire file, or until
they are redefined by another occurrence of the same local label.

   Dollar labels are defined in exactly the same way as ordinary local
labels, except that they have a dollar sign suffix to their numeric
value, e.g., '55$:'.

   They can also be distinguished from ordinary local labels by their
transformed names which use ASCII character '\001' (control-A) as the
magic character to distinguish them from ordinary labels.  For example,
the fifth definition of '6$' may be named '.L6'C-A'5'.

5.4 The Special Dot Symbol
--------------------------

The special symbol '.' refers to the current address that 'as' is
assembling into.  Thus, the expression 'melvin: .long .' defines
'melvin' to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to '.' is
treated the same as a '.org' directive.  Thus, the expression '.=.+4' is
the same as saying '.space 4'.

5.5 Symbol Attributes
---------------------

Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, 'as' assumes zero for all
these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the symbol an
externally defined symbol, which is generally what you would want.

5.5.1 Value
-----------

The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which labels a
location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value is the
number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as 'ld' changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
'ld' tries to determine its value from other files linked into the same
program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a '.comm' common
declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in bytes
(addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the allocated
storage.

5.5.2 Type
----------

The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact
format depends on the object-code output format in use.

--------------------------------

The COFF format supports a multitude of auxiliary symbol attributes;
like the primary symbol attributes, they are set between '.def' and
'.endef' directives.

5.5.4.1 Primary Attributes
--------------------------

The symbol name is set with '.def'; the value and type, respectively,
with '.val' and '.type'.

5.5.4.2 Auxiliary Attributes
----------------------------

The 'as' directives '.dim', '.line', '.scl', '.size', '.tag', and
'.weak' can generate auxiliary symbol table information for COFF.

5.5.5 Symbol Attributes for SOM
-------------------------------

The SOM format for the HPPA supports a multitude of symbol attributes
set with the '.EXPORT' and '.IMPORT' directives.

   The attributes are described in 'HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) under the 'IMPORT' and 'EXPORT'
assembler directive documentation.

6 Expressions
=============

An "expression" specifies an address or numeric value.  Whitespace may
precede and/or follow an expression.

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute, and
there is not enough information when 'as' sees the expression to know
its section, a second pass over the source program might be necessary to
interpret the expression--but the second pass is currently not
implemented.  'as' aborts with an error message in this situation.

6.1 Empty Expressions
---------------------

An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and 'as' assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This is
compatible with other assemblers.

6.2.1 Arguments
---------------

"Arguments" are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other contexts
arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this manual,
to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the machine
language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of expressions
only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine instruction
operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and 'as' pretends these 32
bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating instructions
that act on exotic constants, compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis '(' followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis ')'; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.

6.2.2 Operators

"Operators" are arithmetic functions, like '+' or '%'.  Prefix operators
are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between their
arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by whitespace.

6.2.3 Prefix Operator
---------------------

6.2.4 Infix Operators
---------------------

"Infix operators" take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from '+' or '-', both arguments must be absolute, and
the result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

     '*'
          "Multiplication".

     '/'
          "Division".  Truncation is the same as the C operator '/'

     '%'
          "Remainder".

     '<<'
          "Shift Left".  Same as the C operator '<<'.

     '>>'
          "Shift Right".  Same as the C operator '>>'.

  2. Intermediate precedence

     '|'

          "Bitwise Inclusive Or".

     '&'
          "Bitwise And".

     '^'
          "Bitwise Exclusive Or".

     '!'
          "Bitwise Or Not".

  3. Low Precedence

     '+'
          "Addition".  If either argument is absolute, the result has
          the section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

     '-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

     '=='
          "Is Equal To"
     '<>'
     '!='
          "Is Not Equal To"
     '<'
          "Is Less Than"
     '>'
          "Is Greater Than"
     '>='
          "Is Greater Than Or Equal To"
     '<='
          "Is Less Than Or Equal To"

          The comparison operators can be used as infix operators.  A
          true results has a value of -1 whereas a false result has a
          value of 0.  Note, these operators perform signed comparisons.

  4. Lowest Precedence

     '&&'
          "Logical And".

     '||'
          "Logical Or".

          These two logical operations can be used to combine the
          results of sub expressions.  Note, unlike the comparison
          operators a true result returns a value of 1 but a false
          results does still return 0.  Also note that the logical or
          operator has a slightly lower precedence than logical and.

   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the _offsets_ in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

7 Assembler Directives
======================

All assembler directives have names that begin with a period ('.').  The
names are case insensitive for most targets, and usually written in
lower case.

   This chapter discusses directives that are available regardless of
the target machine configuration for the GNU assembler.  Some machine
configurations provide additional directives.  *Note Machine
Dependencies::.

7.1 '.abort'
------------

This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for compatibility
with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the assembly language
source would be piped into the assembler.  If the sender of the source
quit, it could use this directive tells 'as' to quit also.  One day
'.abort' will not be supported.

7.2 '.ABORT' (COFF)
-------------------

When producing COFF output, 'as' accepts this directive as a synonym for
'.abort'.

7.3 '.align ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
-----------------------------------------

Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on most
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require skipping
more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is not done at
all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument) entirely by
simply using two commas after the required alignment; this can be useful
if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op instructions when
appropriate.

   The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to
system.  For the arc, hppa, i386 using ELF, iq2000, m68k, or1k, s390,
sparc, tic4x, tic80 and xtensa, the first expression is the alignment
request in bytes.  For example '.align 8' advances the location counter
until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.  For the tic54x, the first
expression is the alignment request in words.

   For other systems, including ppc, i386 using a.out format, arm and
strongarm, it is the number of low-order zero bits the location counter
must have after advancement.  For example '.align 3' advances the
location counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is
already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.  GAS also
provides '.balign' and '.p2align' directives, described later, which
have a consistent behavior across all architectures (but are specific to
GAS).

7.4 '.altmacro'
---------------

Enable alternate macro mode, enabling:

'LOCAL NAME [ , ... ]'
     One additional directive, 'LOCAL', is available.  It is used to
     generate a string replacement for each of the NAME arguments, and
     replace any instances of NAME in each macro expansion.  The
     replacement string is unique in the assembly, and different for
     each separate macro expansion.  'LOCAL' allows you to write macros
     that define symbols, without fear of conflict between separate
     macro expansions.

'String delimiters'
     You can write strings delimited in these other ways besides
     '"STRING"':

     ''STRING''
          You can delimit strings with single-quote characters.

     '<STRING>'
          You can delimit strings with matching angle brackets.

'single-character string escape'
     To include any single character literally in a string (even if the
     character would otherwise have some special meaning), you can
     prefix the character with '!' (an exclamation mark).  For example,
     you can write '<4.3 !> 5.4!!>' to get the literal text '4.3 >
     5.4!'.

'Expression results as strings'
     You can write '%EXPR' to evaluate the expression EXPR and use the
     result as a string.

7.5 '.ascii "STRING"'...
------------------------

'.ascii' expects zero or more string literals (*note Strings::)
separated by commas.  It assembles each string (with no automatic
trailing zero byte) into consecutive addresses.

7.8 '.balign[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
----------------------------------------------

Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example '.balign 8' advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on most
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require skipping
more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is not done at
all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument) entirely by
simply using two commas after the required alignment; this can be useful
if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op instructions when
appropriate.

   The '.balignw' and '.balignl' directives are variants of the
'.balign' directive.  The '.balignw' directive treats the fill pattern
as a two byte word value.  The '.balignl' directives treats the fill
pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, '.balignw 4,0x368d'
will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they will be
filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the bytes
depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or 3
bytes, the fill value is undefined.

7.9 Bundle directives
---------------------

7.9.1 '.bundle_align_mode ABS-EXPR'
-----------------------------------

'.bundle_align_mode' enables or disables "aligned instruction bundle"
mode.  In this mode, sequences of adjacent instructions are grouped into
fixed-sized "bundles".  If the argument is zero, this mode is disabled
(which is the default state).  If the argument it not zero, it gives the
size of an instruction bundle as a power of two (as for the '.p2align'
directive, *note P2align::).

   For some targets, it's an ABI requirement that no instruction may
span a certain aligned boundary.  A "bundle" is simply a sequence of
instructions that starts on an aligned boundary.  For example, if
ABS-EXPR is '5' then the bundle size is 32, so each aligned chunk of 32
bytes is a bundle.  When aligned instruction bundle mode is in effect,
no single instruction may span a boundary between bundles.  If an
instruction would start too close to the end of a bundle for the length
of that particular instruction to fit within the bundle, then the space
at the end of that bundle is filled with no-op instructions so the
instruction starts in the next bundle.  As a corollary, it's an error if
any single instruction's encoding is longer than the bundle size.

7.9.2 '.bundle_lock' and '.bundle_unlock'
-----------------------------------------

The '.bundle_lock' and directive '.bundle_unlock' directives allow
explicit control over instruction bundle padding.  These directives are
only valid when '.bundle_align_mode' has been used to enable aligned
instruction bundle mode.  It's an error if they appear when
'.bundle_align_mode' has not been used at all, or when the last
directive was '.bundle_align_mode 0'.

   For some targets, it's an ABI requirement that certain instructions
may appear only as part of specified permissible sequences of multiple
instructions, all within the same bundle.  A pair of '.bundle_lock' and
'.bundle_unlock' directives define a "bundle-locked" instruction
sequence.  For purposes of aligned instruction bundle mode, a sequence
starting with '.bundle_lock' and ending with '.bundle_unlock' is treated
as a single instruction.  That is, the entire sequence must fit into a
single bundle and may not span a bundle boundary.  If necessary, no-op
instructions will be inserted before the first instruction of the
sequence so that the whole sequence starts on an aligned bundle
boundary.  It's an error if the sequence is longer than the bundle size.

   For convenience when using '.bundle_lock' and '.bundle_unlock' inside
assembler macros (*note Macro::), bundle-locked sequences may be nested.
That is, a second '.bundle_lock' directive before the next
'.bundle_unlock' directive has no effect except that it must be matched
by another closing '.bundle_unlock' so that there is the same number of
'.bundle_lock' and '.bundle_unlock' directives.

expression is assembled into the next byte.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    *CFI_directives*

7.11 CFI directives
-------------------

7.11.1 '.cfi_sections SECTION_LIST'
-----------------------------------

'.cfi_sections' may be used to specify whether CFI directives should
emit '.eh_frame' section and/or '.debug_frame' section.  If SECTION_LIST
is '.eh_frame', '.eh_frame' is emitted, if SECTION_LIST is
'.debug_frame', '.debug_frame' is emitted.  To emit both use '.eh_frame,
.debug_frame'.  The default if this directive is not used is
'.cfi_sections .eh_frame'.

   On targets that support compact unwinding tables these can be
generated by specifying '.eh_frame_entry' instead of '.eh_frame'.

   Some targets may support an additional name, such as '.c6xabi.exidx'
which is used by the target.

   The '.cfi_sections' directive can be repeated, with the same or
different arguments, provided that CFI generation has not yet started.
Once CFI generation has started however the section list is fixed and
any attempts to redefine it will result in an error.

7.11.2 '.cfi_startproc [simple]'
--------------------------------

'.cfi_startproc' is used at the beginning of each function that should
have an entry in '.eh_frame'.  It initializes some internal data
structures.  Don't forget to close the function by '.cfi_endproc'.

   Unless '.cfi_startproc' is used along with parameter 'simple' it also
emits some architecture dependent initial CFI instructions.

7.11.3 '.cfi_endproc'
---------------------

'.cfi_endproc' is used at the end of a function where it closes its
unwind entry previously opened by '.cfi_startproc', and emits it to
'.eh_frame'.

7.11.4 '.cfi_personality ENCODING [, EXP]'
------------------------------------------

'.cfi_personality' defines personality routine and its encoding.
ENCODING must be a constant determining how the personality should be
encoded.  If it is 255 ('DW_EH_PE_omit'), second argument is not
present, otherwise second argument should be a constant or a symbol
name.  When using indirect encodings, the symbol provided should be the
location where personality can be loaded from, not the personality
routine itself.  The default after '.cfi_startproc' is '.cfi_personality
0xff', no personality routine.

7.11.5 '.cfi_personality_id ID'
-------------------------------

'cfi_personality_id' defines a personality routine by its index as
defined in a compact unwinding format.  Only valid when generating
compact EH frames (i.e.  with '.cfi_sections eh_frame_entry'.

7.11.6 '.cfi_fde_data [OPCODE1 [, ...]]'
----------------------------------------

'cfi_fde_data' is used to describe the compact unwind opcodes to be used
for the current function.  These are emitted inline in the
'.eh_frame_entry' section if small enough and there is no LSDA, or in
the '.gnu.extab' section otherwise.  Only valid when generating compact
EH frames (i.e.  with '.cfi_sections eh_frame_entry'.

7.11.7 '.cfi_lsda ENCODING [, EXP]'
-----------------------------------

'.cfi_lsda' defines LSDA and its encoding.  ENCODING must be a constant
determining how the LSDA should be encoded.  If it is 255
('DW_EH_PE_omit'), the second argument is not present, otherwise the
second argument should be a constant or a symbol name.  The default
after '.cfi_startproc' is '.cfi_lsda 0xff', meaning that no LSDA is
present.

7.11.8 '.cfi_inline_lsda' [ALIGN]
---------------------------------

'.cfi_inline_lsda' marks the start of a LSDA data section and switches
to the corresponding '.gnu.extab' section.  Must be preceded by a CFI
block containing a '.cfi_lsda' directive.  Only valid when generating
compact EH frames (i.e.  with '.cfi_sections eh_frame_entry'.

   The table header and unwinding opcodes will be generated at this
point, so that they are immediately followed by the LSDA data.  The
symbol referenced by the '.cfi_lsda' directive should still be defined
in case a fallback FDE based encoding is used.  The LSDA data is
terminated by a section directive.

   The optional ALIGN argument specifies the alignment required.  The
alignment is specified as a power of two, as with the '.p2align'
directive.

7.11.9 '.cfi_def_cfa REGISTER, OFFSET'
--------------------------------------

'.cfi_def_cfa' defines a rule for computing CFA as: take address from
REGISTER and add OFFSET to it.

7.11.10 '.cfi_def_cfa_register REGISTER'
----------------------------------------

'.cfi_def_cfa_register' modifies a rule for computing CFA. From now on
REGISTER will be used instead of the old one.  Offset remains the same.

7.11.11 '.cfi_def_cfa_offset OFFSET'
------------------------------------

'.cfi_def_cfa_offset' modifies a rule for computing CFA. Register
remains the same, but OFFSET is new.  Note that it is the absolute
offset that will be added to a defined register to compute CFA address.

7.11.12 '.cfi_adjust_cfa_offset OFFSET'
---------------------------------------

Same as '.cfi_def_cfa_offset' but OFFSET is a relative value that is
added/subtracted from the previous offset.

7.11.13 '.cfi_offset REGISTER, OFFSET'
--------------------------------------

Previous value of REGISTER is saved at offset OFFSET from CFA.

7.11.14 '.cfi_val_offset REGISTER, OFFSET'
------------------------------------------

Previous value of REGISTER is CFA + OFFSET.

7.11.15 '.cfi_rel_offset REGISTER, OFFSET'
------------------------------------------

Previous value of REGISTER is saved at offset OFFSET from the current
CFA register.  This is transformed to '.cfi_offset' using the known
displacement of the CFA register from the CFA. This is often easier to
use, because the number will match the code it's annotating.

7.11.16 '.cfi_register REGISTER1, REGISTER2'
--------------------------------------------

Previous value of REGISTER1 is saved in register REGISTER2.

7.11.17 '.cfi_restore REGISTER'
-------------------------------

'.cfi_restore' says that the rule for REGISTER is now the same as it was
at the beginning of the function, after all initial instruction added by
'.cfi_startproc' were executed.

7.11.18 '.cfi_undefined REGISTER'
---------------------------------

From now on the previous value of REGISTER can't be restored anymore.

7.11.19 '.cfi_same_value REGISTER'
----------------------------------

Current value of REGISTER is the same like in the previous frame, i.e.
no restoration needed.

7.11.20 '.cfi_remember_state' and '.cfi_restore_state'
------------------------------------------------------

'.cfi_remember_state' pushes the set of rules for every register onto an
implicit stack, while '.cfi_restore_state' pops them off the stack and
places them in the current row.  This is useful for situations where you
have multiple '.cfi_*' directives that need to be undone due to the
control flow of the program.  For example, we could have something like
this (assuming the CFA is the value of 'rbp'):

             je label
             popq %rbx
             .cfi_restore %rbx
             popq %r12
             .cfi_restore %r12
             popq %rbp
             .cfi_restore %rbp
             .cfi_def_cfa %rsp, 8
             ret
     label:
             /* Do something else */

   Here, we want the '.cfi' directives to affect only the rows
corresponding to the instructions before 'label'.  This means we'd have
to add multiple '.cfi' directives after 'label' to recreate the original
save locations of the registers, as well as setting the CFA back to the
value of 'rbp'.  This would be clumsy, and result in a larger binary
size.  Instead, we can write:

             je label
             popq %rbx
             .cfi_remember_state
             .cfi_restore %rbx
             popq %r12
             .cfi_restore %r12
             popq %rbp
             .cfi_restore %rbp
             .cfi_def_cfa %rsp, 8
             ret
     label:
             .cfi_restore_state
             /* Do something else */

   That way, the rules for the instructions after 'label' will be the
same as before the first '.cfi_restore' without having to use multiple
'.cfi' directives.

7.11.21 '.cfi_return_column REGISTER'
-------------------------------------

Change return column REGISTER, i.e.  the return address is either
directly in REGISTER or can be accessed by rules for REGISTER.

7.11.22 '.cfi_signal_frame'
---------------------------

Mark current function as signal trampoline.

7.11.23 '.cfi_window_save'
--------------------------

SPARC register window has been saved.

7.11.24 '.cfi_escape' EXPRESSION[, ...]
---------------------------------------

Allows the user to add arbitrary bytes to the unwind info.  One might
use this to add OS-specific CFI opcodes, or generic CFI opcodes that GAS
does not yet support.

7.11.25 '.cfi_val_encoded_addr REGISTER, ENCODING, LABEL'
---------------------------------------------------------

The current value of REGISTER is LABEL.  The value of LABEL will be
encoded in the output file according to ENCODING; see the description of
'.cfi_personality' for details on this encoding.

   The usefulness of equating a register to a fixed label is probably
limited to the return address register.  Here, it can be useful to mark
a code segment that has only one return address which is reached by a
direct branch and no copy of the return address exists in memory or

7.12 '.comm SYMBOL , LENGTH '
-----------------------------

'.comm' declares a common symbol named SYMBOL.  When linking, a common
symbol in one object file may be merged with a defined or common symbol
of the same name in another object file.  If 'ld' does not see a
definition for the symbol-just one or more common symbols-then it will
allocate LENGTH bytes of uninitialized memory.  LENGTH must be an
absolute expression.  If 'ld' sees multiple common symbols with the same
name, and they do not all have the same size, it will allocate space
using the largest size.

   When using ELF or (as a GNU extension) PE, the '.comm' directive
takes an optional third argument.  This is the desired alignment of the
symbol, specified for ELF as a byte boundary (for example, an alignment
of 16 means that the least significant 4 bits of the address should be
zero), and for PE as a power of two (for example, an alignment of 5
means aligned to a 32-byte boundary).  The alignment must be an absolute
expression, and it must be a power of two.  If 'ld' allocates
uninitialized memory for the common symbol, it will use the alignment
when placing the symbol.  If no alignment is specified, 'as' will set
the alignment to the largest power of two less than or equal to the size
of the symbol, up to a maximum of 16 on ELF, or the default section
alignment of 4 on PE(1).

   The syntax for '.comm' differs slightly on the HPPA. The syntax is
'SYMBOL .comm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is not the same as the executable image file alignment
controlled by 'ld''s '--section-alignment' option; image file sections
in PE are aligned to multiples of 4096, which is far too large an
alignment for ordinary variables.  It is rather the default alignment
for (non-debug) sections within object ('*.o') files, which are less
strictly aligned.

7.13 '.data SUBSECTION'

'.data' tells 'as' to assemble the following statements onto the end of
the data subsection numbered SUBSECTION (which is an absolute
expression).  If SUBSECTION is omitted, it defaults to zero.

7.14 '.dc[SIZE] EXPRESSIONS'
----------------------------

The '.dc' directive expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS separated by
commas.  These expressions are evaluated and their values inserted into
the current section.  The size of the emitted value depends upon the
suffix to the '.dc' directive:

''.a''
     Emits N-bit values, where N is the size of an address on the target
     system.
''.b''
     Emits 8-bit values.
''.d''
     Emits double precision floating-point values.
''.l''
     Emits 32-bit values.
''.s''
     Emits single precision floating-point values.
''.w''
     Emits 16-bit values.  Note - this is true even on targets where the
     '.word' directive would emit 32-bit values.
''.x''
     Emits long double precision floating-point values.

   If no suffix is used then '.w' is assumed.

   The byte ordering is target dependent, as is the size and format of
floating point values.

7.15 '.dcb[SIZE] NUMBER [,FILL]'
--------------------------------

This directive emits NUMBER copies of FILL, each of SIZE bytes.  Both
NUMBER and FILL are absolute expressions.  If the comma and FILL are
omitted, FILL is assumed to be zero.  The SIZE suffix, if present, must
be one of:

''.b''
     Emits single byte values.
''.d''
     Emits double-precision floating point values.
''.l''
     Emits 4-byte values.
''.s''
     Emits single-precision floating point values.
''.w''
     Emits 2-byte values.
''.x''
     Emits long double-precision floating point values.

   If the SIZE suffix is omitted then '.w' is assumed.

   The byte ordering is target dependent, as is the size and format of
floating point values.

7.16 '.ds[SIZE] NUMBER [,FILL]'
-------------------------------

This directive emits NUMBER copies of FILL, each of SIZE bytes.  Both
NUMBER and FILL are absolute expressions.  If the comma and FILL are
omitted, FILL is assumed to be zero.  The SIZE suffix, if present, must
be one of:

''.b''
     Emits single byte values.
''.d''

''.l''
     Emits 4-byte values.
''.p''
     Emits 12-byte values.
''.s''
     Emits 4-byte values.
''.w''
     Emits 2-byte values.
''.x''
     Emits 12-byte values.

   Note - unlike the '.dcb' directive the '.d', '.s' and '.x' suffixes
do not indicate that floating-point values are to be inserted.

   If the SIZE suffix is omitted then '.w' is assumed.

   The byte ordering is target dependent.

7.18 '.desc SYMBOL, ABS-EXPRESSION'
-----------------------------------

This directive sets the descriptor of the symbol (*note Symbol

   The '.desc' directive is not available when 'as' is configured for
COFF output; it is only for 'a.out' or 'b.out' object format.  For the
sake of compatibility, 'as' accepts it, but produces no output, when
configured for COFF.

7.23 '.elseif'
--------------

'.elseif' is part of the 'as' support for conditional assembly; see
*note '.if': If.  It is shorthand for beginning a new '.if' block that
would otherwise fill the entire '.else' section.

'.endif' is part of the 'as' support for conditional assembly; it marks
the end of a block of code that is only assembled conditionally.  *Note
'.if': If.

7.28 '.equ SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
------------------------------

This directive sets the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION.  It is synonymous
with '.set'; see *note '.set': Set.

   The syntax for 'equ' on the HPPA is 'SYMBOL .equ EXPRESSION'.

   The syntax for 'equ' on the Z80 is 'SYMBOL equ EXPRESSION'.  On the
Z80 it is an error if SYMBOL is already defined, but the symbol is not
protected from later redefinition.  Compare *note Equiv::.

7.29 '.equiv SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
--------------------------------

The '.equiv' directive is like '.equ' and '.set', except that the
assembler will signal an error if SYMBOL is already defined.  Note a
symbol which has been referenced but not actually defined is considered
to be undefined.

   Except for the contents of the error message, this is roughly
equivalent to
     .ifdef SYM
     .err
     .endif
     .equ SYM,VAL
   plus it protects the symbol from later redefinition.

7.30 '.eqv SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
------------------------------

The '.eqv' directive is like '.equiv', but no attempt is made to
evaluate the expression or any part of it immediately.  Instead each
time the resulting symbol is used in an expression, a snapshot of its
current value is taken.

7.31 '.err'
-----------

If 'as' assembles a '.err' directive, it will print an error message
and, unless the '-Z' option was used, it will not generate an object
file.  This can be used to signal an error in conditionally compiled
code.

7.32 '.error "STRING"'
----------------------

Similarly to '.err', this directive emits an error, but you can specify
a string that will be emitted as the error message.  If you don't
specify the message, it defaults to '".error directive invoked in source
file"'.  *Note Error and Warning Messages: Errors.

      .error "This code has not been assembled and tested."

7.34 '.extern'
--------------

'.extern' is accepted in the source program--for compatibility with
other assemblers--but it is ignored.  'as' treats all undefined symbols
as external.

7.35 '.fail EXPRESSION'
-----------------------

Generates an error or a warning.  If the value of the EXPRESSION is 500
or more, 'as' will print a warning message.  If the value is less than
500, 'as' will print an error message.  The message will include the
value of EXPRESSION.  This can occasionally be useful inside complex
nested macros or conditional assembly.

7.36 '.file'
------------

There are two different versions of the '.file' directive.  Targets that
support DWARF2 line number information use the DWARF2 version of
'.file'.  Other targets use the default version.

Default Version
---------------

This version of the '.file' directive tells 'as' that we are about to
start a new logical file.  The syntax is:

     .file STRING

   STRING is the new file name.  In general, the filename is recognized
whether or not it is surrounded by quotes '"'; but if you wish to
specify an empty file name, you must give the quotes-'""'.  This
statement may go away in future: it is only recognized to be compatible
with old 'as' programs.

DWARF2 Version
--------------

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, '.file' assigns filenames
to the '.debug_line' file name table.  The syntax is:

     .file FILENO FILENAME

   The FILENO operand should be a unique positive integer to use as the
index of the entry in the table.  The FILENAME operand is a C string
literal.

   The detail of filename indices is exposed to the user because the
filename table is shared with the '.debug_info' section of the DWARF2
debugging information, and thus the user must know the exact indices
that table entries will have.

7.37 '.fill REPEAT , SIZE , VALUE'
----------------------------------

REPEAT, SIZE and VALUE are absolute expressions.  This emits REPEAT
copies of SIZE bytes.  REPEAT may be zero or more.  SIZE may be zero or
more, but if it is more than 8, then it is deemed to have the value 8,
compatible with other people's assemblers.  The contents of each REPEAT
bytes is taken from an 8-byte number.  The highest order 4 bytes are
zero.  The lowest order 4 bytes are VALUE rendered in the byte-order of
an integer on the computer 'as' is assembling for.  Each SIZE bytes in a
repetition is taken from the lowest order SIZE bytes of this number.
Again, this bizarre behavior is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   SIZE and VALUE are optional.  If the second comma and VALUE are
absent, VALUE is assumed zero.  If the first comma and following tokens
are absent, SIZE is assumed to be 1.

7.38 '.float FLONUMS'
---------------------

This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It
has the same effect as '.single'.  The exact kind of floating point
numbers emitted depends on how 'as' is configured.  *Note Machine

7.39 '.func NAME[,LABEL]'
-------------------------

'.func' emits debugging information to denote function NAME, and is
ignored unless the file is assembled with debugging enabled.  Only
'--gstabs[+]' is currently supported.  LABEL is the entry point of the
function and if omitted NAME prepended with the 'leading char' is used.
'leading char' is usually '_' or nothing, depending on the target.  All
functions are currently defined to have 'void' return type.  The
function must be terminated with '.endfunc'.

7.40 '.global SYMBOL', '.globl SYMBOL'
--------------------------------------

'.global' makes the symbol visible to 'ld'.  If you define SYMBOL in
your partial program, its value is made available to other partial
programs that are linked with it.  Otherwise, SYMBOL takes its
attributes from a symbol of the same name from another file linked into
the same program.

   Both spellings ('.globl' and '.global') are accepted, for
compatibility with other assemblers.

   On the HPPA, '.global' is not always enough to make it accessible to
other partial programs.  You may need the HPPA-only '.EXPORT' directive
as well.  *Note HPPA Assembler Directives: HPPA Directives.

7.42 '.hidden NAMES'
--------------------

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
'.internal' (*note '.internal': Internal.) and '.protected' (*note
'.protected': Protected.).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets the
visibility to 'hidden' which means that the symbols are not visible to
other components.  Such symbols are always considered to be 'protected'
as well.

7.43 '.hword EXPRESSIONS'
-------------------------

This expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS, and emits a 16 bit number for
each.

   This directive is a synonym for '.short'; depending on the target
architecture, it may also be a synonym for '.word'.

7.44 '.ident'
-------------

This directive is used by some assemblers to place tags in object files.
The behavior of this directive varies depending on the target.  When
using the a.out object file format, 'as' simply accepts the directive
for source-file compatibility with existing assemblers, but does not
emit anything for it.  When using COFF, comments are emitted to the
'.comment' or '.rdata' section, depending on the target.  When using
ELF, comments are emitted to the '.comment' section.

7.45 '.if ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
------------------------------

'.if' marks the beginning of a section of code which is only considered
part of the source program being assembled if the argument (which must
be an ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION) is non-zero.  The end of the conditional
section of code must be marked by '.endif' (*note '.endif': Endif.);
optionally, you may include code for the alternative condition, flagged
by '.else' (*note '.else': Else.).  If you have several conditions to
check, '.elseif' may be used to avoid nesting blocks if/else within each
subsequent '.else' block.

   The following variants of '.if' are also supported:
'.ifdef SYMBOL'
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL has
     been defined.  Note a symbol which has been referenced but not yet
     defined is considered to be undefined.

'.ifb TEXT'
     Assembles the following section of code if the operand is blank
     (empty).

'.ifc STRING1,STRING2'
     Assembles the following section of code if the two strings are the
     same.  The strings may be optionally quoted with single quotes.  If
     they are not quoted, the first string stops at the first comma, and
     the second string stops at the end of the line.  Strings which
     contain whitespace should be quoted.  The string comparison is case
     sensitive.

'.ifeq ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is zero.

'.ifeqs STRING1,STRING2'
     Another form of '.ifc'.  The strings must be quoted using double
     quotes.

'.ifge ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater
     than or equal to zero.

'.ifgt ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater
     than zero.

'.ifle ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less
     than or equal to zero.

'.iflt ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less
     than zero.

'.ifnb TEXT'
     Like '.ifb', but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles
     the following section of code if the operand is non-blank
     (non-empty).

'.ifnc STRING1,STRING2.'
     Like '.ifc', but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles
     the following section of code if the two strings are not the same.

'.ifndef SYMBOL'
'.ifnotdef SYMBOL'
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL has
     not been defined.  Both spelling variants are equivalent.  Note a
     symbol which has been referenced but not yet defined is considered
     to be undefined.

'.ifne ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is not
     equal to zero (in other words, this is equivalent to '.if').

'.ifnes STRING1,STRING2'
     Like '.ifeqs', but the sense of the test is reversed: this
     assembles the following section of code if the two strings are not
     the same.

7.46 '.incbin "FILE"[,SKIP[,COUNT]]'
------------------------------------

The 'incbin' directive includes FILE verbatim at the current location.
You can control the search paths used with the '-I' command-line option
(*note Command-Line Options: Invoking.).  Quotation marks are required
around FILE.

   The SKIP argument skips a number of bytes from the start of the FILE.
The COUNT argument indicates the maximum number of bytes to read.  Note
that the data is not aligned in any way, so it is the user's
responsibility to make sure that proper alignment is provided both
before and after the 'incbin' directive.

7.47 '.include "FILE"'
----------------------

This directive provides a way to include supporting files at specified
points in your source program.  The code from FILE is assembled as if it
followed the point of the '.include'; when the end of the included file
is reached, assembly of the original file continues.  You can control
the search paths used with the '-I' command-line option (*note
Command-Line Options: Invoking.).  Quotation marks are required around
FILE.

7.48 '.int EXPRESSIONS'
-----------------------

Expect zero or more EXPRESSIONS, of any section, separated by commas.
For each expression, emit a number that, at run time, is the value of
that expression.  The byte order and bit size of the number depends on
what kind of target the assembly is for.

7.49 '.internal NAMES'
----------------------

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
'.hidden' (*note '.hidden': Hidden.) and '.protected' (*note
'.protected': Protected.).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets the
visibility to 'internal' which means that the symbols are considered to
be 'hidden' (i.e., not visible to other components), and that some
extra, processor specific processing must also be performed upon the
symbols as well.

7.50 '.irp SYMBOL,VALUES'...
----------------------------

Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to SYMBOL.
The sequence of statements starts at the '.irp' directive, and is
terminated by an '.endr' directive.  For each VALUE, SYMBOL is set to
VALUE, and the sequence of statements is assembled.  If no VALUE is
listed, the sequence of statements is assembled once, with SYMBOL set to
the null string.  To refer to SYMBOL within the sequence of statements,
use \SYMBOL.

   For example, assembling

             .irp    param,1,2,3
             move    d\param,sp@-
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             move    d1,sp@-
             move    d2,sp@-
             move    d3,sp@-

7.51 '.irpc SYMBOL,VALUES'...
-----------------------------

Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to SYMBOL.
The sequence of statements starts at the '.irpc' directive, and is
terminated by an '.endr' directive.  For each character in VALUE, SYMBOL
is set to the character, and the sequence of statements is assembled.
If no VALUE is listed, the sequence of statements is assembled once,
with SYMBOL set to the null string.  To refer to SYMBOL within the
sequence of statements, use \SYMBOL.

   For example, assembling

             .irpc    param,123
             move    d\param,sp@-
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             move    d1,sp@-
             move    d2,sp@-
             move    d3,sp@-

7.52 '.lcomm SYMBOL , LENGTH'
-----------------------------

Reserve LENGTH (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common denoted
by SYMBOL.  The section and value of SYMBOL are those of the new local
common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss section, so that at
run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  SYMBOL is not declared global
(*note '.global': Global.), so is normally not visible to 'ld'.

   Some targets permit a third argument to be used with '.lcomm'.  This
argument specifies the desired alignment of the symbol in the bss
section.

   The syntax for '.lcomm' differs slightly on the HPPA. The syntax is
'SYMBOL .lcomm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.

7.54 '.line LINE-NUMBER'
------------------------

Change the logical line number.  LINE-NUMBER must be an absolute
expression.  The next line has that logical line number.  Therefore any
other statements on the current line (after a statement separator
character) are reported as on logical line number LINE-NUMBER - 1.  One
day 'as' will no longer support this directive: it is recognized only
for compatibility with existing assembler programs.

   Even though this is a directive associated with the 'a.out' or
'b.out' object-code formats, 'as' still recognizes it when producing
COFF output, and treats '.line' as though it were the COFF '.ln' _if_ it
is found outside a '.def'/'.endef' pair.

   Inside a '.def', '.line' is, instead, one of the directives used by
compilers to generate auxiliary symbol information for debugging.

7.55 '.linkonce [TYPE]'
-----------------------

Mark the current section so that the linker only includes a single copy
of it.  This may be used to include the same section in several
different object files, but ensure that the linker will only include it
once in the final output file.  The '.linkonce' pseudo-op must be used
for each instance of the section.  Duplicate sections are detected based
on the section name, so it should be unique.

   This directive is only supported by a few object file formats; as of
this writing, the only object file format which supports it is the
Portable Executable format used on Windows NT.

   The TYPE argument is optional.  If specified, it must be one of the
following strings.  For example:
     .linkonce same_size
   Not all types may be supported on all object file formats.

'discard'
     Silently discard duplicate sections.  This is the default.

'one_only'
     Warn if there are duplicate sections, but still keep only one copy.

'same_size'
     Warn if any of the duplicates have different sizes.

'same_contents'
     Warn if any of the duplicates do not have exactly the same
     contents.

7.56 '.list'
------------

Control (in conjunction with the '.nolist' directive) whether or not
assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).  '.list' increments the
counter, and '.nolist' decrements it.  Assembly listings are generated
whenever the counter is greater than zero.

   By default, listings are disabled.  When you enable them (with the
'-a' command line option; *note Command-Line Options: Invoking.), the
initial value of the listing counter is one.

7.58 '.loc FILENO LINENO [COLUMN] [OPTIONS]'
--------------------------------------------

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, the '.loc' directive will
add a row to the '.debug_line' line number matrix corresponding to the
immediately following assembly instruction.  The FILENO, LINENO, and
optional COLUMN arguments will be applied to the '.debug_line' state
machine before the row is added.

   The OPTIONS are a sequence of the following tokens in any order:

'basic_block'
     This option will set the 'basic_block' register in the
     '.debug_line' state machine to 'true'.

'prologue_end'
     This option will set the 'prologue_end' register in the
     '.debug_line' state machine to 'true'.

'epilogue_begin'
     This option will set the 'epilogue_begin' register in the
     '.debug_line' state machine to 'true'.

'is_stmt VALUE'
     This option will set the 'is_stmt' register in the '.debug_line'
     state machine to 'value', which must be either 0 or 1.

'isa VALUE'
     This directive will set the 'isa' register in the '.debug_line'
     state machine to VALUE, which must be an unsigned integer.

'discriminator VALUE'
     This directive will set the 'discriminator' register in the
     '.debug_line' state machine to VALUE, which must be an unsigned
     integer.

'view VALUE'
     This option causes a row to be added to '.debug_line' in reference
     to the current address (which might not be the same as that of the
     following assembly instruction), and to associate VALUE with the
     'view' register in the '.debug_line' state machine.  If VALUE is a
     label, both the 'view' register and the label are set to the number
     of prior '.loc' directives at the same program location.  If VALUE
     is the literal '0', the 'view' register is set to zero, and the
     assembler asserts that there aren't any prior '.loc' directives at
     the same program location.  If VALUE is the literal '-0', the
     assembler arrange for the 'view' register to be reset in this row,
     even if there are prior '.loc' directives at the same program
     location.

7.59 '.loc_mark_labels ENABLE'
------------------------------

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, the '.loc_mark_labels'
directive makes the assembler emit an entry to the '.debug_line' line
number matrix with the 'basic_block' register in the state machine set
whenever a code label is seen.  The ENABLE argument should be either 1
or 0, to enable or disable this function respectively.

7.60 '.local NAMES'
-------------------

This directive, which is available for ELF targets, marks each symbol in
the comma-separated list of 'names' as a local symbol so that it will
not be externally visible.  If the symbols do not already exist, they
will be created.

   For targets where the '.lcomm' directive (*note Lcomm::) does not
accept an alignment argument, which is the case for most ELF targets,
the '.local' directive can be used in combination with '.comm' (*note
Comm::) to define aligned local common data.

7.62 '.macro'
-------------

The commands '.macro' and '.endm' allow you to define macros that
generate assembly output.  For example, this definition specifies a
macro 'sum' that puts a sequence of numbers into memory:

             .macro  sum from=0, to=5
             .long   \from
             .if     \to-\from
             sum     "(\from+1)",\to
             .endif
             .endm

With that definition, 'SUM 0,5' is equivalent to this assembly input:

             .long   0
             .long   1
             .long   2
             .long   3
             .long   4
             .long   5

'.macro MACNAME'
'.macro MACNAME MACARGS ...'
     Begin the definition of a macro called MACNAME.  If your macro
     definition requires arguments, specify their names after the macro
     name, separated by commas or spaces.  You can qualify the macro
     argument to indicate whether all invocations must specify a
     non-blank value (through ':'req''), or whether it takes all of the
     remaining arguments (through ':'vararg'').  You can supply a
     default value for any macro argument by following the name with
     '=DEFLT'.  You cannot define two macros with the same MACNAME
     unless it has been subject to the '.purgem' directive (*note
     Purgem::) between the two definitions.  For example, these are all
     valid '.macro' statements:

     '.macro comm'
          Begin the definition of a macro called 'comm', which takes no
          arguments.

     '.macro plus1 p, p1'
     '.macro plus1 p p1'
          Either statement begins the definition of a macro called
          'plus1', which takes two arguments; within the macro
          definition, write '\p' or '\p1' to evaluate the arguments.

     '.macro reserve_str p1=0 p2'
          Begin the definition of a macro called 'reserve_str', with two
          arguments.  The first argument has a default value, but not
          the second.  After the definition is complete, you can call
          the macro either as 'reserve_str A,B' (with '\p1' evaluating
          to A and '\p2' evaluating to B), or as 'reserve_str ,B' (with
          '\p1' evaluating as the default, in this case '0', and '\p2'
          evaluating to B).

     '.macro m p1:req, p2=0, p3:vararg'
          Begin the definition of a macro called 'm', with at least
          three arguments.  The first argument must always have a value
          specified, but not the second, which instead has a default
          value.  The third formal will get assigned all remaining
          arguments specified at invocation time.

          When you call a macro, you can specify the argument values
          either by position, or by keyword.  For example, 'sum 9,17' is
          equivalent to 'sum to=17, from=9'.

     Note that since each of the MACARGS can be an identifier exactly as
     any other one permitted by the target architecture, there may be
     occasional problems if the target hand-crafts special meanings to
     certain characters when they occur in a special position.  For
     example, if the colon (':') is generally permitted to be part of a
     symbol name, but the architecture specific code special-cases it
     when occurring as the final character of a symbol (to denote a
     label), then the macro parameter replacement code will have no way
     of knowing that and consider the whole construct (including the
     colon) an identifier, and check only this identifier for being the
     subject to parameter substitution.  So for example this macro
     definition:

          	.macro label l
          \l:
          	.endm

     might not work as expected.  Invoking 'label foo' might not create
     a label called 'foo' but instead just insert the text '\l:' into
     the assembler source, probably generating an error about an
     unrecognised identifier.

     Similarly problems might occur with the period character ('.')
     which is often allowed inside opcode names (and hence identifier
     names).  So for example constructing a macro to build an opcode
     from a base name and a length specifier like this:

          	.macro opcode base length
                  \base.\length
          	.endm

     and invoking it as 'opcode store l' will not create a 'store.l'
     instruction but instead generate some kind of error as the
     assembler tries to interpret the text '\base.\length'.

     There are several possible ways around this problem:

     'Insert white space'
          If it is possible to use white space characters then this is
          the simplest solution.  eg:

               	.macro label l
               \l :
               	.endm

     'Use '\()''
          The string '\()' can be used to separate the end of a macro
          argument from the following text.  eg:

               	.macro opcode base length
                       \base\().\length
               	.endm

     'Use the alternate macro syntax mode'
          In the alternative macro syntax mode the ampersand character
          ('&') can be used as a separator.  eg:

               	.altmacro
               	.macro label l
               l&:
               	.endm

     Note: this problem of correctly identifying string parameters to
     pseudo ops also applies to the identifiers used in '.irp' (*note
     Irp::) and '.irpc' (*note Irpc::) as well.

'.endm'
     Mark the end of a macro definition.

'.exitm'
     Exit early from the current macro definition.

'\@'
     'as' maintains a counter of how many macros it has executed in this
     pseudo-variable; you can copy that number to your output with '\@',
     but _only within a macro definition_.

'LOCAL NAME [ , ... ]'
     _Warning: 'LOCAL' is only available if you select "alternate macro
     syntax" with '--alternate' or '.altmacro'._  *Note '.altmacro':
     Altmacro.

7.65 '.nolist'
--------------

Control (in conjunction with the '.list' directive) whether or not
assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).  '.list' increments the
counter, and '.nolist' decrements it.  Assembly listings are generated
whenever the counter is greater than zero.

7.66 '.nops SIZE[, CONTROL]'
----------------------------

This directive emits SIZE bytes filled with no-op instructions.  SIZE is
absolute expression, which must be a positve value.  CONTROL controls
how no-op instructions should be generated.  If the comma and CONTROL
are omitted, CONTROL is assumed to be zero.

   Note: For Intel 80386 and AMD x86-64 targets, CONTROL specifies the
size limit of a no-op instruction.  The valid values of CONTROL are
between 0 and 4 in 16-bit mode, between 0 and 7 when tuning for older
processors in 32-bit mode, between 0 and 11 in 64-bit mode or when
tuning for newer processors in 32-bit mode.  When 0 is used, the no-op
instruction size limit is set to the maximum supported size.

7.67 '.octa BIGNUMS'
--------------------

This directive expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For
each bignum, it emits a 16-byte integer.

   The term "octa" comes from contexts in which a "word" is two bytes;
hence _octa_-word for 16 bytes.

7.68 '.offset LOC'
------------------

Set the location counter to LOC in the absolute section.  LOC must be an
absolute expression.  This directive may be useful for defining symbols
with absolute values.  Do not confuse it with the '.org' directive.

7.69 '.org NEW-LC , FILL'
-------------------------

Advance the location counter of the current section to NEW-LC.  NEW-LC
is either an absolute expression or an expression with the same section
as the current subsection.  That is, you can't use '.org' to cross
sections: if NEW-LC has the wrong section, the '.org' directive is
ignored.  To be compatible with former assemblers, if the section of
NEW-LC is absolute, 'as' issues a warning, then pretends the section of
NEW-LC is the same as the current subsection.

   '.org' may only increase the location counter, or leave it unchanged;
you cannot use '.org' to move the location counter backwards.

   Because 'as' tries to assemble programs in one pass, NEW-LC may not
be undefined.  If you really detest this restriction we eagerly await a
chance to share your improved assembler.

   Beware that the origin is relative to the start of the section, not
to the start of the subsection.  This is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   When the location counter (of the current subsection) is advanced,
the intervening bytes are filled with FILL which should be an absolute
expression.  If the comma and FILL are omitted, FILL defaults to zero.

7.70 '.p2align[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
------------------------------------------------

Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example '.p2align 3' advances the location counter
until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a multiple
of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on most
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require skipping
more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is not done at
all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument) entirely by
simply using two commas after the required alignment; this can be useful
if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op instructions when
appropriate.

   The '.p2alignw' and '.p2alignl' directives are variants of the
'.p2align' directive.  The '.p2alignw' directive treats the fill pattern
as a two byte word value.  The '.p2alignl' directives treats the fill
pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, '.p2alignw
2,0x368d' will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they
will be filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the
bytes depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or 3
bytes, the fill value is undefined.

   This directive replaces the current section (and subsection) with the
top section (and subsection) on the section stack.  This section is
popped off the stack.

7.72 '.previous'
----------------

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are '.section' (*note Section::), '.subsection' (*note
SubSection::), '.pushsection' (*note PushSection::), and '.popsection'
(*note PopSection::).

   This directive swaps the current section (and subsection) with most
recently referenced section/subsection pair prior to this one.  Multiple
'.previous' directives in a row will flip between two sections (and
their subsections).  For example:

     .section A
      .subsection 1
       .word 0x1234
      .subsection 2
       .word 0x5678
     .previous
      .word 0x9abc

   Will place 0x1234 and 0x9abc into subsection 1 and 0x5678 into
subsection 2 of section A. Whilst:

     .section A
     .subsection 1
       # Now in section A subsection 1
       .word 0x1234
     .section B
     .subsection 0
       # Now in section B subsection 0
       .word 0x5678
     .subsection 1
       # Now in section B subsection 1
       .word 0x9abc
     .previous
       # Now in section B subsection 0
       .word 0xdef0

   Will place 0x1234 into section A, 0x5678 and 0xdef0 into subsection 0
of section B and 0x9abc into subsection 1 of section B.

   In terms of the section stack, this directive swaps the current
section with the top section on the section stack.

7.74 '.protected NAMES'
-----------------------

This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
'.hidden' (*note Hidden::) and '.internal' (*note Internal::).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets the
visibility to 'protected' which means that any references to the symbols
from within the components that defines them must be resolved to the
definition in that component, even if a definition in another component
would normally preempt this.

You may omit the comma and COLUMNS specification; the default width is
200 columns.

   'as' generates formfeeds whenever the specified number of lines is
exceeded (or whenever you explicitly request one, using '.eject').

   If you specify LINES as '0', no formfeeds are generated save those
explicitly specified with '.eject'.

7.77 '.pushsection NAME [, SUBSECTION] [, "FLAGS"[, @TYPE[,ARGUMENTS]]]'
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are '.section' (*note Section::), '.subsection' (*note
SubSection::), '.popsection' (*note PopSection::), and '.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   This directive pushes the current section (and subsection) onto the
top of the section stack, and then replaces the current section and
subsection with 'name' and 'subsection'.  The optional 'flags', 'type'
and 'arguments' are treated the same as in the '.section' (*note
Section::) directive.

7.78 '.quad BIGNUMS'
--------------------

'.quad' expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For each
bignum, it emits an 8-byte integer.  If the bignum won't fit in 8 bytes,
it prints a warning message; and just takes the lowest order 8 bytes of
the bignum.

   The term "quad" comes from contexts in which a "word" is two bytes;
hence _quad_-word for 8 bytes.

7.79 '.reloc OFFSET, RELOC_NAME[, EXPRESSION]'
----------------------------------------------

Generate a relocation at OFFSET of type RELOC_NAME with value
EXPRESSION.  If OFFSET is a number, the relocation is generated in the
current section.  If OFFSET is an expression that resolves to a symbol
plus offset, the relocation is generated in the given symbol's section.
EXPRESSION, if present, must resolve to a symbol plus addend or to an
absolute value, but note that not all targets support an addend.  e.g.
ELF REL targets such as i386 store an addend in the section contents
rather than in the relocation.  This low level interface does not
support addends stored in the section.

7.80 '.rept COUNT'
------------------

Repeat the sequence of lines between the '.rept' directive and the next
'.endr' directive COUNT times.

   For example, assembling

             .rept   3
             .long   0
             .endr

   is equivalent to assembling

             .long   0
             .long   0
             .long   0

   A count of zero is allowed, but nothing is generated.  Negative
counts are not allowed and if encountered will be treated as if they
were zero.

7.81 '.sbttl "SUBHEADING"'
--------------------------

7.82 '.scl CLASS'
-----------------

used inside a '.def'/'.endef' pair.  Storage class may flag whether a
symbol is static or external, or it may record further symbolic
debugging information.

7.83 '.section NAME'
--------------------

Use the '.section' directive to assemble the following code into a
section named NAME.

   This directive is only supported for targets that actually support
arbitrarily named sections; on 'a.out' targets, for example, it is not
accepted, even with a standard 'a.out' section name.

COFF Version
------------

For COFF targets, the '.section' directive is used in one of the
following ways:

     .section NAME[, "FLAGS"]
     .section NAME[, SUBSECTION]

   If the optional argument is quoted, it is taken as flags to use for
the section.  Each flag is a single character.  The following flags are
recognized:

'b'
     bss section (uninitialized data)
'n'
     section is not loaded
'w'
     writable section
'd'
     data section
'e'
     exclude section from linking
'r'
     read-only section
'x'
     executable section
's'
     shared section (meaningful for PE targets)
'a'
     ignored.  (For compatibility with the ELF version)
'y'
     section is not readable (meaningful for PE targets)
'0-9'
     single-digit power-of-two section alignment (GNU extension)

   If no flags are specified, the default flags depend upon the section
name.  If the section name is not recognized, the default will be for
the section to be loaded and writable.  Note the 'n' and 'w' flags
remove attributes from the section, rather than adding them, so if they
are used on their own it will be as if no flags had been specified at
all.

   If the optional argument to the '.section' directive is not quoted,
it is taken as a subsection number (*note Sub-Sections::).

ELF Version
-----------

This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The
others are '.subsection' (*note SubSection::), '.pushsection' (*note
PushSection::), '.popsection' (*note PopSection::), and '.previous'
(*note Previous::).

   For ELF targets, the '.section' directive is used like this:

     .section NAME [, "FLAGS"[, @TYPE[,FLAG_SPECIFIC_ARGUMENTS]]]

   If the '--sectname-subst' command-line option is provided, the NAME
argument may contain a substitution sequence.  Only '%S' is supported at
the moment, and substitutes the current section name.  For example:

     .macro exception_code
     .section %S.exception
     [exception code here]
     .previous
     .endm

     .text
     [code]
     exception_code
     [...]

     .section .init
     [init code]
     exception_code
     [...]

   The two 'exception_code' invocations above would create the
'.text.exception' and '.init.exception' sections respectively.  This is
useful e.g.  to discriminate between ancillary sections that are tied to
setup code to be discarded after use from ancillary sections that need
to stay resident without having to define multiple 'exception_code'
