'as' has the following machine-dependent directives for the H8/300:

'.h8300h'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8/300H variant,
     and also make '.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather than the usual
     (16-bit) for the H8/300 family.

'.h8300s'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8S variant, and
     also make '.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather than the usual (16-bit)
     for the H8/300 family.

'.h8300hn'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8/300H variant
     in normal mode, and also make '.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather
     than the usual (16-bit) for the H8/300 family.

'.h8300sn'
     Recognize and emit additional instructions for the H8S variant in
     normal mode, and also make '.int' emit 32-bit numbers rather than
     the usual (16-bit) for the H8/300 family.

   On the H8/300 family (including the H8/300H) '.word' directives
generate 16-bit numbers.

For detailed information on the H8/300 machine instruction set, see
'H8/300 Series Programming Manual'.  For information specific to the
H8/300H, see 'H8/300H Series Programming Manual' (Renesas).

   'as' implements all the standard H8/300 opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.

   The following table summarizes the H8/300 opcodes, and their
arguments.  Entries marked '*' are opcodes used only on the H8/300H.

   Four H8/300 instructions ('add', 'cmp', 'mov', 'sub') are defined
with variants using the suffixes '.b', '.w', and '.l' to specify the
size of a memory operand.  'as' supports these suffixes, but does not
require them; since one of the operands is always a register, 'as' can
deduce the correct size.

   For example, since 'r0' refers to a 16-bit register,
     mov    r0,@foo
is equivalent to
     mov.w  r0,@foo

   If you use the size suffixes, 'as' issues a warning when the suffix
and the register size do not match.

9.13.1 Notes
------------

As a back end for GNU CC 'as' has been thoroughly tested and should work
extremely well.  We have tested it only minimally on hand written
assembly code and no one has tested it much on the assembly output from
the HP compilers.

   The format of the debugging sections has changed since the original
'as' port (version 1.3X) was released; therefore, you must rebuild all
HPPA objects and libraries with the new assembler so that you can debug
the final executable.

   The HPPA 'as' port generates a small subset of the relocations
available in the SOM and ELF object file formats.  Additional relocation
support will be added as it becomes necessary.

9.13.3 Syntax
-------------

The assembler syntax closely follows the HPPA instruction set reference
manual; assembler directives and general syntax closely follow the HPPA
assembly language reference manual, with a few noteworthy differences.

   First, a colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is
simply for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers
write code.

   Some obscure expression parsing problems may affect hand written code
which uses the 'spop' instructions, or code which makes significant use
of the '!' line separator.

   'as' is much less forgiving about missing arguments and other similar
oversights than the HP assembler.  'as' notifies you of missing
arguments as syntax errors; this is regarded as a feature, not a bug.

   Finally, 'as' allows you to use an external symbol without explicitly
importing the symbol.  _Warning:_ in the future this will be an error
for HPPA targets.

   Special characters for HPPA targets include:

   ';' is the line comment character.

   '!' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since '$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

9.13.5 HPPA Assembler Directives
--------------------------------

'as' for the HPPA supports many additional directives for compatibility
with the native assembler.  This section describes them only briefly.
For detailed information on HPPA-specific assembler directives, see
'HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001).

   'as' does _not_ support the following assembler directives described
in the HP manual:

     .endm           .liston
     .enter          .locct
     .leave          .macro
     .listoff

   Beyond those implemented for compatibility, 'as' supports one
additional assembler directive for the HPPA: '.param'.  It conveys
register argument locations for static functions.  Its syntax closely
follows the '.export' directive.

   These are the additional directives in 'as' for the HPPA:

'.block N'
'.blockz N'
     Reserve N bytes of storage, and initialize them to zero.

'.call'
     Mark the beginning of a procedure call.  Only the special case with
     _no arguments_ is allowed.

'.callinfo [ PARAM=VALUE, ... ] [ FLAG, ... ]'
     Specify a number of parameters and flags that define the
     environment for a procedure.

     PARAM may be any of 'frame' (frame size), 'entry_gr' (end of
     general register range), 'entry_fr' (end of float register range),
     'entry_sr' (end of space register range).

     The values for FLAG are 'calls' or 'caller' (proc has subroutines),
     'no_calls' (proc does not call subroutines), 'save_rp' (preserve
     return pointer), 'save_sp' (proc preserves stack pointer),
     'no_unwind' (do not unwind this proc), 'hpux_int' (proc is
     interrupt routine).

'.code'
     Assemble into the standard section called '$TEXT$', subsection
     '$CODE$'.

'.copyright "STRING"'
     In the SOM object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a copyright string.

'.copyright "STRING"'
     In the ELF object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a version string.

'.enter'
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

'.entry'
     Mark the beginning of a procedure.

'.exit'
     Mark the end of a procedure.

'.export NAME [ ,TYP ] [ ,PARAM=R ]'
     Make a procedure NAME available to callers.  TYP, if present, must
     be one of 'absolute', 'code' (ELF only, not SOM), 'data', 'entry',
     'data', 'entry', 'millicode', 'plabel', 'pri_prog', or 'sec_prog'.

     PARAM, if present, provides either relocation information for the
     procedure arguments and result, or a privilege level.  PARAM may be
     'argwN' (where N ranges from '0' to '3', and indicates one of four
     one-word arguments); 'rtnval' (the procedure's result); or
     'priv_lev' (privilege level).  For arguments or the result, R
     specifies how to relocate, and must be one of 'no' (not
     relocatable), 'gr' (argument is in general register), 'fr' (in
     floating point register), or 'fu' (upper half of float register).
     For 'priv_lev', R is an integer.

'.half N'
     Define a two-byte integer constant N; synonym for the portable 'as'
     directive '.short'.

'.import NAME [ ,TYP ]'
     Converse of '.export'; make a procedure available to call.  The
     arguments use the same conventions as the first two arguments for
     '.export'.

'.label NAME'
     Define NAME as a label for the current assembly location.

'.leave'
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

'.origin LC'
     Advance location counter to LC.  Synonym for the 'as' portable
     directive '.org'.

'.param NAME [ ,TYP ] [ ,PARAM=R ]'
     Similar to '.export', but used for static procedures.

'.proc'
     Use preceding the first statement of a procedure.

'.procend'
     Use following the last statement of a procedure.

'LABEL .reg EXPR'
     Synonym for '.equ'; define LABEL with the absolute expression EXPR
     as its value.

'.space SECNAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
     Switch to section SECNAME, creating a new section by that name if
     necessary.  You may only use PARAMS when creating a new section,
     not when switching to an existing one.  SECNAME may identify a
     section by number rather than by name.

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the section,
     identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are 'spnum=EXP'
     (identify this section by the number EXP, an absolute expression),
     'sort=EXP' (order sections according to this sort key when linking;
     EXP is an absolute expression), 'unloadable' (section contains no
     loadable data), 'notdefined' (this section defined elsewhere), and
     'private' (data in this section not available to other programs).

'.spnum SECNAM'
     Allocate four bytes of storage, and initialize them with the
     section number of the section named SECNAM.  (You can define the
     section number with the HPPA '.space' directive.)

'.string "STR"'
     Copy the characters in the string STR to the object file.  *Note
     Strings: Strings, for information on escape sequences you can use
     in 'as' strings.

     _Warning!_  The HPPA version of '.string' differs from the usual
     'as' definition: it does _not_ write a zero byte after copying STR.

'.stringz "STR"'
     Like '.string', but appends a zero byte after copying STR to object
     file.

'.subspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
'.nsubspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
     Similar to '.space', but selects a subsection NAME within the
     current section.  You may only specify PARAMS when you create a
     subsection (in the first instance of '.subspa' for this NAME).

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the
     subsection, identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are
     'quad=EXPR' ("quadrant" for this subsection), 'align=EXPR'
     (alignment for beginning of this subsection; a power of two),
     'access=EXPR' (value for "access rights" field), 'sort=EXPR'
     (sorting order for this subspace in link), 'code_only' (subsection
     contains only code), 'unloadable' (subsection cannot be loaded into
     memory), 'comdat' (subsection is comdat), 'common' (subsection is
     common block), 'dup_comm' (subsection may have duplicate names), or
     'zero' (subsection is all zeros, do not write in object file).

     '.nsubspa' always creates a new subspace with the given name, even
     if one with the same name already exists.

     'comdat', 'common' and 'dup_comm' can be used to implement various
     flavors of one-only support when using the SOM linker.  The SOM
     linker only supports specific combinations of these flags.  The
     details are not documented.  A brief description is provided here.

     'comdat' provides a form of linkonce support.  It is useful for
     both code and data subspaces.  A 'comdat' subspace has a key symbol
     marked by the 'is_comdat' flag or 'ST_COMDAT'.  Only the first
     subspace for any given key is selected.  The key symbol becomes
     universal in shared links.  This is similar to the behavior of
     'secondary_def' symbols.

     'common' provides Fortran named common support.  It is only useful
     for data subspaces.  Symbols with the flag 'is_common' retain this
     flag in shared links.  Referencing a 'is_common' symbol in a shared
     library from outside the library doesn't work.  Thus, 'is_common'
     symbols must be output whenever they are needed.

     'common' and 'dup_comm' together provide Cobol common support.  The
     subspaces in this case must all be the same length.  Otherwise,
     this support is similar to the Fortran common support.

     'dup_comm' by itself provides a type of one-only support for code.
     Only the first 'dup_comm' subspace is selected.  There is a rather
     complex algorithm to compare subspaces.  Code symbols marked with
     the 'dup_common' flag are hidden.  This support was intended for
     "C++ duplicate inlines".

     A simplified technique is used to mark the flags of symbols based
     on the flags of their subspace.  A symbol with the scope
     SS_UNIVERSAL and type ST_ENTRY, ST_CODE or ST_DATA is marked with
     the corresponding settings of 'comdat', 'common' and 'dup_comm'
     from the subspace, respectively.  This avoids having to introduce
     additional directives to mark these symbols.  The HP assembler sets
     'is_common' from 'common'.  However, it doesn't set the
     'dup_common' from 'dup_comm'.  It doesn't have 'comdat' support.

'.version "STR"'
     Write STR as version identifier in object code.

9.14.1 Options
--------------

The i386 version of 'as' has a few machine dependent options:

'--32 | --x32 | --64'
     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  '--32' implies
     Intel i386 architecture, while '--x32' and '--64' imply AMD x86-64
     architecture with 32-bit or 64-bit word-size respectively.

     These options are only available with the ELF object file format,
     and require that the necessary BFD support has been included (on a
     32-bit platform you have to add -enable-64-bit-bfd to configure
     enable 64-bit usage and use x86-64 as target platform).

'-n'
     By default, x86 GAS replaces multiple nop instructions used for
     alignment within code sections with multi-byte nop instructions
     such as leal 0(%esi,1),%esi.  This switch disables the optimization
     if a single byte nop (0x90) is explicitly specified as the fill
     byte for alignment.

'--divide'
     On SVR4-derived platforms, the character '/' is treated as a
     comment character, which means that it cannot be used in
     expressions.  The '--divide' option turns '/' into a normal
     character.  This does not disable '/' at the beginning of a line
     starting a comment, or affect using '#' for starting a comment.

'-march=CPU[+EXTENSION...]'
     This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler will
     issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble an

     following processor names are recognized: 'i8086', 'i186', 'i286',
     'i386', 'i486', 'i586', 'i686', 'pentium', 'pentiumpro',

     'generic32' and 'generic64'.

     In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told
     to accept various extension mnemonics.  For example,
     '-march=i686+sse4+vmx' extends I686 with SSE4 and VMX.  The
     following extensions are currently supported: '8087', '287', '387',

     'sse4a', 'sse5', 'svme', 'abm' and 'padlock'.  Note that rather
     than extending a basic instruction set, the extension mnemonics
     starting with 'no' revoke the respective functionality.

     When the '.arch' directive is used with '-march', the '.arch'
     directive will take precedent.

'-mtune=CPU'
     This option specifies a processor to optimize for.  When used in
     conjunction with the '-march' option, only instructions of the
     processor specified by the '-march' option will be generated.

     Valid CPU values are identical to the processor list of
     '-march=CPU'.

'-msse2avx'
     This option specifies that the assembler should encode SSE
     instructions with VEX prefix.

'-msse-check=NONE'
'-msse-check=WARNING'
'-msse-check=ERROR'
     These options control if the assembler should check SSE
     instructions.  '-msse-check=NONE' will make the assembler not to
     check SSE instructions, which is the default.
     '-msse-check=WARNING' will make the assembler issue a warning for
     any SSE instruction.  '-msse-check=ERROR' will make the assembler
     issue an error for any SSE instruction.

'-mavxscalar=128'
'-mavxscalar=256'
     These options control how the assembler should encode scalar AVX
     instructions.  '-mavxscalar=128' will encode scalar AVX
     instructions with 128bit vector length, which is the default.
     '-mavxscalar=256' will encode scalar AVX instructions with 256bit
     vector length.

'-mevexlig=128'
'-mevexlig=256'
'-mevexlig=512'
     These options control how the assembler should encode
     length-ignored (LIG) EVEX instructions.  '-mevexlig=128' will
     encode LIG EVEX instructions with 128bit vector length, which is
     the default.  '-mevexlig=256' and '-mevexlig=512' will encode LIG
     EVEX instructions with 256bit and 512bit vector length,
     respectively.

'-mevexwig=0'
'-mevexwig=1'
     These options control how the assembler should encode w-ignored
     (WIG) EVEX instructions.  '-mevexwig=0' will encode WIG EVEX
     instructions with evex.w = 0, which is the default.  '-mevexwig=1'
     will encode WIG EVEX instructions with evex.w = 1.

'-mmnemonic=ATT'
'-mmnemonic=INTEL'
     This option specifies instruction mnemonic for matching
     instructions.  The '.att_mnemonic' and '.intel_mnemonic' directives
     will take precedent.

'-msyntax=ATT'
'-msyntax=INTEL'
     This option specifies instruction syntax when processing
     instructions.  The '.att_syntax' and '.intel_syntax' directives
     will take precedent.

'-mnaked-reg'
     This option specifies that registers don't require a '%' prefix.
     The '.att_syntax' and '.intel_syntax' directives will take
     precedent.

'-madd-bnd-prefix'
     This option forces the assembler to add BND prefix to all branches,
     even if such prefix was not explicitly specified in the source
     code.

'-mno-shared'
     On ELF target, the assembler normally optimizes out non-PLT
     relocations against defined non-weak global branch targets with
     default visibility.  The '-mshared' option tells the assembler to
     generate code which may go into a shared library where all non-weak
     global branch targets with default visibility can be preempted.
     The resulting code is slightly bigger.  This option only affects
     the handling of branch instructions.

'-mbig-obj'
     On x86-64 PE/COFF target this option forces the use of big object
     file format, which allows more than 32768 sections.

'-momit-lock-prefix=NO'
'-momit-lock-prefix=YES'
     These options control how the assembler should encode lock prefix.
     This option is intended as a workaround for processors, that fail
     on lock prefix.  This option can only be safely used with
     single-core, single-thread computers '-momit-lock-prefix=YES' will
     omit all lock prefixes.  '-momit-lock-prefix=NO' will encode lock
     prefix as usual, which is the default.

'-mfence-as-lock-add=NO'
'-mfence-as-lock-add=YES'
     These options control how the assembler should encode lfence,
     mfence and sfence.  '-mfence-as-lock-add=YES' will encode lfence,
     mfence and sfence as 'lock addl $0x0, (%rsp)' in 64-bit mode and
     'lock addl $0x0, (%esp)' in 32-bit mode.  '-mfence-as-lock-add=NO'
     will encode lfence, mfence and sfence as usual, which is the
     default.

'-mrelax-relocations=NO'
'-mrelax-relocations=YES'
     These options control whether the assembler should generate relax
     relocations, R_386_GOT32X, in 32-bit mode, or R_X86_64_GOTPCRELX
     and R_X86_64_REX_GOTPCRELX, in 64-bit mode.
     '-mrelax-relocations=YES' will generate relax relocations.
     '-mrelax-relocations=NO' will not generate relax relocations.  The
     default can be controlled by a configure option
     '--enable-x86-relax-relocations'.

'-mevexrcig=RNE'
'-mevexrcig=RD'
'-mevexrcig=RU'
'-mevexrcig=RZ'
     These options control how the assembler should encode SAE-only EVEX
     instructions.  '-mevexrcig=RNE' will encode RC bits of EVEX
     instruction with 00, which is the default.  '-mevexrcig=RD',
     '-mevexrcig=RU' and '-mevexrcig=RZ' will encode SAE-only EVEX
     instructions with 01, 10 and 11 RC bits, respectively.

'-mamd64'
'-mintel64'
     This option specifies that the assembler should accept only AMD64
     or Intel64 ISA in 64-bit mode.  The default is to accept both.

'-O0 | -O | -O1 | -O2 | -Os'
     Optimize instruction encoding with smaller instruction size.  '-O'
     and '-O1' encode 64-bit register load instructions with 64-bit
     immediate as 32-bit register load instructions with 31-bit or
     32-bits immediates and encode 64-bit register clearing instructions
     with 32-bit register clearing instructions.  '-O2' includes '-O1'
     optimization plus encodes 256-bit and 512-bit vector register
     clearing instructions with 128-bit vector register clearing
     instructions.  '-Os' includes '-O2' optimization plus encodes
     16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit register tests with immediate as 8-bit
     register test with immediate.  '-O0' turns off this optimization.

9.14.2 x86 specific Directives
------------------------------

'.lcomm SYMBOL , LENGTH[, ALIGNMENT]'
     Reserve LENGTH (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
     denoted by SYMBOL.  The section and value of SYMBOL are those of
     the new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss
     section, so that at run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  Since
     SYMBOL is not declared global, it is normally not visible to 'ld'.
     The optional third parameter, ALIGNMENT, specifies the desired
     alignment of the symbol in the bss section.

     This directive is only available for COFF based x86 targets.

'.largecomm SYMBOL , LENGTH[, ALIGNMENT]'
     This directive behaves in the same way as the 'comm' directive
     except that the data is placed into the .LBSS section instead of
     the .BSS section *note Comm::.

     The directive is intended to be used for data which requires a
     large amount of space, and it is only available for ELF based
     x86_64 targets.

9.14.3.1 AT&T Syntax versus Intel Syntax
----------------------------------------

'as' now supports assembly using Intel assembler syntax.
'.intel_syntax' selects Intel mode, and '.att_syntax' switches back to
the usual AT&T mode for compatibility with the output of 'gcc'.  Either
of these directives may have an optional argument, 'prefix', or
'noprefix' specifying whether registers require a '%' prefix.  AT&T
System V/386 assembler syntax is quite different from Intel syntax.  We
mention these differences because almost all 80386 documents use Intel
syntax.  Notable differences between the two syntaxes are:

   * AT&T immediate operands are preceded by '$'; Intel immediate
     operands are undelimited (Intel 'push 4' is AT&T 'pushl $4').  AT&T
     register operands are preceded by '%'; Intel register operands are
     undelimited.  AT&T absolute (as opposed to PC relative) jump/call
     operands are prefixed by '*'; they are undelimited in Intel syntax.

   * AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for source and
     destination operands.  Intel 'add eax, 4' is 'addl $4, %eax'.  The
     'source, dest' convention is maintained for compatibility with
     previous Unix assemblers.  Note that 'bound', 'invlpga', and
     instructions with 2 immediate operands, such as the 'enter'
     instruction, do _not_ have reversed order.  *note i386-Bugs::.

   * In AT&T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the
     last character of the instruction mnemonic.  Mnemonic suffixes of
     'b', 'w', 'l' and 'q' specify byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), long
     (32-bit) and quadruple word (64-bit) memory references.  Intel
     syntax accomplishes this by prefixing memory operands (_not_ the
     instruction mnemonics) with 'byte ptr', 'word ptr', 'dword ptr' and
     'qword ptr'.  Thus, Intel 'mov al, byte ptr FOO' is 'movb FOO, %al'
     in AT&T syntax.

     In 64-bit code, 'movabs' can be used to encode the 'mov'
     instruction with the 64-bit displacement or immediate operand.

   * Immediate form long jumps and calls are 'lcall/ljmp $SECTION,
     $OFFSET' in AT&T syntax; the Intel syntax is 'call/jmp far
     SECTION:OFFSET'.  Also, the far return instruction is 'lret
     $STACK-ADJUST' in AT&T syntax; Intel syntax is 'ret far
     STACK-ADJUST'.

   * The AT&T assembler does not provide support for multiple section
     programs.  Unix style systems expect all programs to be single
     sections.

9.14.3.2 Special Characters
---------------------------

The presence of a '#' appearing anywhere on a line indicates the start
of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a '#' appears as the first character of a line then the whole line
is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   If the '--divide' command line option has not been specified then the
'/' character appearing anywhere on a line also introduces a line
comment.

   The ';' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.14.4 i386-Mnemonics
---------------------

9.14.4.1 Instruction Naming
---------------------------

Instruction mnemonics are suffixed with one character modifiers which
specify the size of operands.  The letters 'b', 'w', 'l' and 'q' specify
byte, word, long and quadruple word operands.  If no suffix is specified
by an instruction then 'as' tries to fill in the missing suffix based on
the destination register operand (the last one by convention).  Thus,
'mov %ax, %bx' is equivalent to 'movw %ax, %bx'; also, 'mov $1, %bx' is
equivalent to 'movw $1, bx'.  Note that this is incompatible with the
AT&T Unix assembler which assumes that a missing mnemonic suffix implies
long operand size.  (This incompatibility does not affect compiler
output since compilers always explicitly specify the mnemonic suffix.)

   Almost all instructions have the same names in AT&T and Intel format.
There are a few exceptions.  The sign extend and zero extend
instructions need two sizes to specify them.  They need a size to
sign/zero extend _from_ and a size to zero extend _to_.  This is
accomplished by using two instruction mnemonic suffixes in AT&T syntax.
Base names for sign extend and zero extend are 'movs...' and 'movz...'
in AT&T syntax ('movsx' and 'movzx' in Intel syntax).  The instruction
mnemonic suffixes are tacked on to this base name, the _from_ suffix
before the _to_ suffix.  Thus, 'movsbl %al, %edx' is AT&T syntax for
"move sign extend _from_ %al _to_ %edx."  Possible suffixes, thus, are
'bl' (from byte to long), 'bw' (from byte to word), 'wl' (from word to
long), 'bq' (from byte to quadruple word), 'wq' (from word to quadruple
word), and 'lq' (from long to quadruple word).

   Different encoding options can be specified via pseudo prefixes:

   * '{disp8}' - prefer 8-bit displacement.

   * '{disp32}' - prefer 32-bit displacement.

   * '{load}' - prefer load-form instruction.

   * '{store}' - prefer store-form instruction.

   * '{vex2}' - prefer 2-byte VEX prefix for VEX instruction.

   * '{vex3}' - prefer 3-byte VEX prefix for VEX instruction.

   * '{evex}' - encode with EVEX prefix.

   * '{rex}' - prefer REX prefix for integer and legacy vector
     instructions (x86-64 only).  Note that this differs from the 'rex'
     prefix which generates REX prefix unconditionally.

   * '{nooptimize}' - disable instruction size optimization.

   The Intel-syntax conversion instructions

   * 'cbw' -- sign-extend byte in '%al' to word in '%ax',

   * 'cwde' -- sign-extend word in '%ax' to long in '%eax',

   * 'cdq' -- sign-extend dword in '%eax' to quad in '%edx:%eax',

   * 'cdqe' -- sign-extend dword in '%eax' to quad in '%rax' (x86-64
     only),

are called 'cbtw', 'cwtl', 'cwtd', 'cltd', 'cltq', and 'cqto' in AT&T
naming.  'as' accepts either naming for these instructions.

   Far call/jump instructions are 'lcall' and 'ljmp' in AT&T syntax, but
are 'call far' and 'jump far' in Intel convention.

9.14.4.2 AT&T Mnemonic versus Intel Mnemonic
--------------------------------------------

'as' supports assembly using Intel mnemonic.  '.intel_mnemonic' selects
Intel mnemonic with Intel syntax, and '.att_mnemonic' switches back to
the usual AT&T mnemonic with AT&T syntax for compatibility with the
output of 'gcc'.  Several x87 instructions, 'fadd', 'fdiv', 'fdivp',
'fdivr', 'fdivrp', 'fmul', 'fsub', 'fsubp', 'fsubr' and 'fsubrp', are
implemented in AT&T System V/386 assembler with different mnemonics from
those in Intel IA32 specification.  'gcc' generates those instructions
with AT&T mnemonic.

9.14.5 Register Naming
----------------------

Register operands are always prefixed with '%'.  The 80386 registers
consist of

   * the 8 32-bit registers '%eax' (the accumulator), '%ebx', '%ecx',
     '%edx', '%edi', '%esi', '%ebp' (the frame pointer), and '%esp' (the
     stack pointer).

   * the 8 16-bit low-ends of these: '%ax', '%bx', '%cx', '%dx', '%di',
     '%si', '%bp', and '%sp'.

   * the 8 8-bit registers: '%ah', '%al', '%bh', '%bl', '%ch', '%cl',
     '%dh', and '%dl' (These are the high-bytes and low-bytes of '%ax',
     '%bx', '%cx', and '%dx')

   * the 6 section registers '%cs' (code section), '%ds' (data section),
     '%ss' (stack section), '%es', '%fs', and '%gs'.

   * the 5 processor control registers '%cr0', '%cr2', '%cr3', '%cr4',
     and '%cr8'.

   * the 6 debug registers '%db0', '%db1', '%db2', '%db3', '%db6', and
     '%db7'.

   * the 2 test registers '%tr6' and '%tr7'.

   * the 8 floating point register stack '%st' or equivalently '%st(0)',
     '%st(1)', '%st(2)', '%st(3)', '%st(4)', '%st(5)', '%st(6)', and
     '%st(7)'.  These registers are overloaded by 8 MMX registers
     '%mm0', '%mm1', '%mm2', '%mm3', '%mm4', '%mm5', '%mm6' and '%mm7'.

   * the 8 128-bit SSE registers registers '%xmm0', '%xmm1', '%xmm2',
     '%xmm3', '%xmm4', '%xmm5', '%xmm6' and '%xmm7'.

   The AMD x86-64 architecture extends the register set by:

   * enhancing the 8 32-bit registers to 64-bit: '%rax' (the
     accumulator), '%rbx', '%rcx', '%rdx', '%rdi', '%rsi', '%rbp' (the
     frame pointer), '%rsp' (the stack pointer)

   * the 8 extended registers '%r8'-'%r15'.

   * the 8 32-bit low ends of the extended registers: '%r8d'-'%r15d'.

   * the 8 16-bit low ends of the extended registers: '%r8w'-'%r15w'.

   * the 8 8-bit low ends of the extended registers: '%r8b'-'%r15b'.

   * the 4 8-bit registers: '%sil', '%dil', '%bpl', '%spl'.

   * the 8 debug registers: '%db8'-'%db15'.

   * the 8 128-bit SSE registers: '%xmm8'-'%xmm15'.

   With the AVX extensions more registers were made available:

   * the 16 256-bit SSE '%ymm0'-'%ymm15' (only the first 8 available in
     32-bit mode).  The bottom 128 bits are overlaid with the
     'xmm0'-'xmm15' registers.

   The AVX2 extensions made in 64-bit mode more registers available:

   * the 16 128-bit registers '%xmm16'-'%xmm31' and the 16 256-bit
     registers '%ymm16'-'%ymm31'.

   The AVX512 extensions added the following registers:

   * the 32 512-bit registers '%zmm0'-'%zmm31' (only the first 8
     available in 32-bit mode).  The bottom 128 bits are overlaid with
     the '%xmm0'-'%xmm31' registers and the first 256 bits are overlaid
     with the '%ymm0'-'%ymm31' registers.

   * the 8 mask registers '%k0'-'%k7'.

9.14.6 Instruction Prefixes
---------------------------

Instruction prefixes are used to modify the following instruction.  They
are used to repeat string instructions, to provide section overrides, to
perform bus lock operations, and to change operand and address sizes.
(Most instructions that normally operate on 32-bit operands will use
16-bit operands if the instruction has an "operand size" prefix.)
Instruction prefixes are best written on the same line as the
instruction they act upon.  For example, the 'scas' (scan string)
instruction is repeated with:

             repne scas %es:(%edi),%al

   You may also place prefixes on the lines immediately preceding the
instruction, but this circumvents checks that 'as' does with prefixes,
and will not work with all prefixes.

   Here is a list of instruction prefixes:

   * Section override prefixes 'cs', 'ds', 'ss', 'es', 'fs', 'gs'.
     These are automatically added by specifying using the
     SECTION:MEMORY-OPERAND form for memory references.

   * Operand/Address size prefixes 'data16' and 'addr16' change 32-bit
     operands/addresses into 16-bit operands/addresses, while 'data32'
     and 'addr32' change 16-bit ones (in a '.code16' section) into
     32-bit operands/addresses.  These prefixes _must_ appear on the
     same line of code as the instruction they modify.  For example, in
     a 16-bit '.code16' section, you might write:

                  addr32 jmpl *(%ebx)

   * The bus lock prefix 'lock' inhibits interrupts during execution of
     the instruction it precedes.  (This is only valid with certain
     instructions; see a 80386 manual for details).

   * The wait for coprocessor prefix 'wait' waits for the coprocessor to
     complete the current instruction.  This should never be needed for
     the 80386/80387 combination.

   * The 'rep', 'repe', and 'repne' prefixes are added to string
     instructions to make them repeat '%ecx' times ('%cx' times if the
     current address size is 16-bits).
   * The 'rex' family of prefixes is used by x86-64 to encode extensions
     to i386 instruction set.  The 'rex' prefix has four bits -- an
     operand size overwrite ('64') used to change operand size from
     32-bit to 64-bit and X, Y and Z extensions bits used to extend the
     register set.

     You may write the 'rex' prefixes directly.  The 'rex64xyz'
     instruction emits 'rex' prefix with all the bits set.  By omitting
     the '64', 'x', 'y' or 'z' you may write other prefixes as well.
     Normally, there is no need to write the prefixes explicitly, since
     gas will automatically generate them based on the instruction
     operands.

9.14.7 Memory References
------------------------

An Intel syntax indirect memory reference of the form

     SECTION:[BASE + INDEX*SCALE + DISP]

is translated into the AT&T syntax

     SECTION:DISP(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)

where BASE and INDEX are the optional 32-bit base and index registers,
DISP is the optional displacement, and SCALE, taking the values 1, 2, 4,
and 8, multiplies INDEX to calculate the address of the operand.  If no
SCALE is specified, SCALE is taken to be 1.  SECTION specifies the
optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the
default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register
defaults).  Note that section overrides in AT&T syntax _must_ be
preceded by a '%'.  If you specify a section override which coincides
with the default section register, 'as' does _not_ output any section
register override prefixes to assemble the given instruction.  Thus,
section overrides can be specified to emphasize which section register
is used for a given memory operand.

   Here are some examples of Intel and AT&T style memory references:

AT&T: '-4(%ebp)', Intel: '[ebp - 4]'
     BASE is '%ebp'; DISP is '-4'.  SECTION is missing, and the default
     section is used ('%ss' for addressing with '%ebp' as the base
     register).  INDEX, SCALE are both missing.

AT&T: 'foo(,%eax,4)', Intel: '[foo + eax*4]'
     INDEX is '%eax' (scaled by a SCALE 4); DISP is 'foo'.  All other
     fields are missing.  The section register here defaults to '%ds'.

AT&T: 'foo(,1)'; Intel '[foo]'
     This uses the value pointed to by 'foo' as a memory operand.  Note
     that BASE and INDEX are both missing, but there is only _one_ ','.
     This is a syntactic exception.

AT&T: '%gs:foo'; Intel 'gs:foo'
     This selects the contents of the variable 'foo' with section
     register SECTION being '%gs'.

   Absolute (as opposed to PC relative) call and jump operands must be
prefixed with '*'.  If no '*' is specified, 'as' always chooses PC
relative addressing for jump/call labels.

   Any instruction that has a memory operand, but no register operand,
_must_ specify its size (byte, word, long, or quadruple) with an
instruction mnemonic suffix ('b', 'w', 'l' or 'q', respectively).

   The x86-64 architecture adds an RIP (instruction pointer relative)
addressing.  This addressing mode is specified by using 'rip' as a base
register.  Only constant offsets are valid.  For example:

AT&T: '1234(%rip)', Intel: '[rip + 1234]'
     Points to the address 1234 bytes past the end of the current
     instruction.

AT&T: 'symbol(%rip)', Intel: '[rip + symbol]'
     Points to the 'symbol' in RIP relative way, this is shorter than
     the default absolute addressing.

   Other addressing modes remain unchanged in x86-64 architecture,
except registers used are 64-bit instead of 32-bit.

9.14.8 Handling of Jump Instructions
------------------------------------

Jump instructions are always optimized to use the smallest possible
displacements.  This is accomplished by using byte (8-bit) displacement
jumps whenever the target is sufficiently close.  If a byte displacement
is insufficient a long displacement is used.  We do not support word
(16-bit) displacement jumps in 32-bit mode (i.e.  prefixing the jump
instruction with the 'data16' instruction prefix), since the 80386
insists upon masking '%eip' to 16 bits after the word displacement is
added.  (See also *note i386-Arch::)

   Note that the 'jcxz', 'jecxz', 'loop', 'loopz', 'loope', 'loopnz' and
'loopne' instructions only come in byte displacements, so that if you
use these instructions ('gcc' does not use them) you may get an error
message (and incorrect code).  The AT&T 80386 assembler tries to get
around this problem by expanding 'jcxz foo' to

              jcxz cx_zero
              jmp cx_nonzero
     cx_zero: jmp foo
     cx_nonzero:

9.14.9 Floating Point
---------------------

All 80387 floating point types except packed BCD are supported.  (BCD
support may be added without much difficulty).  These data types are
16-, 32-, and 64- bit integers, and single (32-bit), double (64-bit),
and extended (80-bit) precision floating point.  Each supported type has
an instruction mnemonic suffix and a constructor associated with it.
Instruction mnemonic suffixes specify the operand's data type.
Constructors build these data types into memory.

   * Floating point constructors are '.float' or '.single', '.double',
     and '.tfloat' for 32-, 64-, and 80-bit formats.  These correspond
     to instruction mnemonic suffixes 's', 'l', and 't'.  't' stands for
     80-bit (ten byte) real.  The 80387 only supports this format via
     the 'fldt' (load 80-bit real to stack top) and 'fstpt' (store
     80-bit real and pop stack) instructions.

   * Integer constructors are '.word', '.long' or '.int', and '.quad'
     for the 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer formats.  The corresponding
     instruction mnemonic suffixes are 's' (single), 'l' (long), and 'q'
     (quad).  As with the 80-bit real format, the 64-bit 'q' format is
     only present in the 'fildq' (load quad integer to stack top) and
     'fistpq' (store quad integer and pop stack) instructions.

   Register to register operations should not use instruction mnemonic
suffixes.  'fstl %st, %st(1)' will give a warning, and be assembled as
if you wrote 'fst %st, %st(1)', since all register to register
operations use 80-bit floating point operands.  (Contrast this with
'fstl %st, mem', which converts '%st' from 80-bit to 64-bit floating
point format, then stores the result in the 4 byte location 'mem')

9.14.10 Intel's MMX and AMD's 3DNow! SIMD Operations
----------------------------------------------------

'as' supports Intel's MMX instruction set (SIMD instructions for integer
data), available on Intel's Pentium MMX processors and Pentium II
processors, AMD's K6 and K6-2 processors, Cyrix' M2 processor, and
probably others.  It also supports AMD's 3DNow! instruction set (SIMD
instructions for 32-bit floating point data) available on AMD's K6-2
processor and possibly others in the future.

   Currently, 'as' does not support Intel's floating point SIMD, Katmai
(KNI).

   The eight 64-bit MMX operands, also used by 3DNow!, are called
'%mm0', '%mm1', ...  '%mm7'.  They contain eight 8-bit integers, four
16-bit integers, two 32-bit integers, one 64-bit integer, or two 32-bit
floating point values.  The MMX registers cannot be used at the same
time as the floating point stack.

   See Intel and AMD documentation, keeping in mind that the operand
order in instructions is reversed from the Intel syntax.

9.14.11 AMD's Lightweight Profiling Instructions
------------------------------------------------

'as' supports AMD's Lightweight Profiling (LWP) instruction set,
available on AMD's Family 15h (Orochi) processors.

   LWP enables applications to collect and manage performance data, and
react to performance events.  The collection of performance data
requires no context switches.  LWP runs in the context of a thread and
so several counters can be used independently across multiple threads.
LWP can be used in both 64-bit and legacy 32-bit modes.

   For detailed information on the LWP instruction set, see the 'AMD
Lightweight Profiling Specification' available at Lightweight Profiling
Specification (http://developer.amd.com/cpu/LWP).

9.14.14 Writing 16-bit Code
---------------------------

While 'as' normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code or 64-bit x86-64
code depending on the default configuration, it also supports writing
code to run in real mode or in 16-bit protected mode code segments.  To
do this, put a '.code16' or '.code16gcc' directive before the assembly
language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.  You can switch 'as' to
writing 32-bit code with the '.code32' directive or 64-bit code with the
'.code64' directive.

   '.code16gcc' provides experimental support for generating 16-bit code
from gcc, and differs from '.code16' in that 'call', 'ret', 'enter',
'leave', 'push', 'pop', 'pusha', 'popa', 'pushf', and 'popf'
instructions default to 32-bit size.  This is so that the stack pointer
is manipulated in the same way over function calls, allowing access to
function parameters at the same stack offsets as in 32-bit mode.
'.code16gcc' also automatically adds address size prefixes where
necessary to use the 32-bit addressing modes that gcc generates.

   The code which 'as' generates in 16-bit mode will not necessarily run
on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write code that runs on such a
processor, you must refrain from using _any_ 32-bit constructs which
require 'as' to output address or operand size prefixes.

   Note that writing 16-bit code instructions by explicitly specifying a
prefix or an instruction mnemonic suffix within a 32-bit code section
generates different machine instructions than those generated for a
16-bit code segment.  In a 32-bit code section, the following code
generates the machine opcode bytes '66 6a 04', which pushes the value
'4' onto the stack, decrementing '%esp' by 2.

             pushw $4

   The same code in a 16-bit code section would generate the machine
opcode bytes '6a 04' (i.e., without the operand size prefix), which is
correct since the processor default operand size is assumed to be 16
bits in a 16-bit code section.

9.14.15 Specifying CPU Architecture
-----------------------------------

'as' may be told to assemble for a particular CPU (sub-)architecture
with the '.arch CPU_TYPE' directive.  This directive enables a warning
when gas detects an instruction that is not supported on the CPU
specified.  The choices for CPU_TYPE are:

'i8086'        'i186'         'i286'         'i386'

'corei7'       'l1om'         'k1om'
                              'iamcu'
'k6'           'k6_2'         'athlon'       'k8'

'.padlock'     '.clzero'      '.mwaitx'

   Apart from the warning, there are only two other effects on 'as'
operation; Firstly, if you specify a CPU other than 'i486', then shift
by one instructions such as 'sarl $1, %eax' will automatically use a two
byte opcode sequence.  The larger three byte opcode sequence is used on
the 486 (and when no architecture is specified) because it executes
faster on the 486.  Note that you can explicitly request the two byte
opcode by writing 'sarl %eax'.  Secondly, if you specify 'i8086',
'i186', or 'i286', _and_ '.code16' or '.code16gcc' then byte offset
conditional jumps will be promoted when necessary to a two instruction
sequence consisting of a conditional jump of the opposite sense around
an unconditional jump to the target.

   Following the CPU architecture (but not a sub-architecture, which are
those starting with a dot), you may specify 'jumps' or 'nojumps' to
control automatic promotion of conditional jumps.  'jumps' is the
default, and enables jump promotion; All external jumps will be of the
long variety, and file-local jumps will be promoted as necessary.
(*note i386-Jumps::) 'nojumps' leaves external conditional jumps as byte
offset jumps, and warns about file-local conditional jumps that 'as'
promotes.  Unconditional jumps are treated as for 'jumps'.

   For example

      .arch i8086,nojumps

9.14.16 AT&T Syntax bugs
------------------------

The UnixWare assembler, and probably other AT&T derived ix86 Unix
assemblers, generate floating point instructions with reversed source
and destination registers in certain cases.  Unfortunately, gcc and
possibly many other programs use this reversed syntax, so we're stuck
with it.

   For example

             fsub %st,%st(3)
results in '%st(3)' being updated to '%st - %st(3)' rather than the
expected '%st(3) - %st'.  This happens with all the non-commutative
arithmetic floating point operations with two register operands where
the source register is '%st' and the destination register is '%st(i)'.

9.14.17 Notes
-------------

There is some trickery concerning the 'mul' and 'imul' instructions that
deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, 64- and 128-bit expanding multiplies
(base opcode '0xf6'; extension 4 for 'mul' and 5 for 'imul') can be
output only in the one operand form.  Thus, 'imul %ebx, %eax' does _not_
select the expanding multiply; the expanding multiply would clobber the
'%edx' register, and this would confuse 'gcc' output.  Use 'imul %ebx'
to get the 64-bit product in '%edx:%eax'.

   We have added a two operand form of 'imul' when the first operand is
an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.  This
is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying '%eax' by 69, for example, can
be done with 'imul $69, %eax' rather than 'imul $69, %eax, %eax'.

9.15.1 Options
--------------

'-mconstant-gp'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP" model.  With this model, it is
     assumed that the entire program uses a single global pointer (GP)
     value.  Note that this option does not in any fashion affect the
     machine code emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

'-mauto-pic'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP without function descriptor" data
     model.  This model is like the "constant GP" model, except that it
     additionally does away with function descriptors.  What this means
     is that the address of a function refers directly to the function's
     code entry-point.  Normally, such an address would refer to a
     function descriptor, which contains both the code entry-point and
     the GP-value needed by the function.  Note that this option does
     not in any fashion affect the machine code emitted by the
     assembler.  All it does is turn on the EF_IA_64_NOFUNCDESC_CONS_GP
     flag in the ELF file header.

'-milp32'
'-milp64'
'-mlp64'
'-mp64'
     These options select the data model.  The assembler defaults to
     '-mlp64' (LP64 data model).

'-mle'
'-mbe'
     These options select the byte order.  The '-mle' option selects
     little-endian byte order (default) and '-mbe' selects big-endian
     byte order.  Note that IA-64 machine code always uses little-endian
     byte order.

'-mtune=itanium1'
'-mtune=itanium2'
     Tune for a particular IA-64 CPU, ITANIUM1 or ITANIUM2.  The default
     is ITANIUM2.

'-munwind-check=warning'
'-munwind-check=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when performing
     consistency checks on unwind directives.  '-munwind-check=warning'
     will make the assembler issue a warning when an unwind directive
     check fails.  This is the default.  '-munwind-check=error' will
     make the assembler issue an error when an unwind directive check
     fails.

'-mhint.b=ok'
'-mhint.b=warning'
'-mhint.b=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when the 'hint.b'
     instruction is used.  '-mhint.b=ok' will make the assembler accept
     'hint.b'.  '-mint.b=warning' will make the assembler issue a
     warning when 'hint.b' is used.  '-mhint.b=error' will make the
     assembler treat 'hint.b' as an error, which is the default.

'-x'
'-xexplicit'
     These options turn on dependency violation checking.

'-xauto'
     This option instructs the assembler to automatically insert stop
     bits where necessary to remove dependency violations.  This is the
     default mode.

'-xnone'
     This option turns off dependency violation checking.

'-xdebug'
     This turns on debug output intended to help tracking down bugs in
     the dependency violation checker.

'-xdebugn'
     This is a shortcut for -xnone -xdebug.

'-xdebugx'
     This is a shortcut for -xexplicit -xdebug.

9.15.2.2 Register Names
-----------------------

The 128 integer registers are referred to as 'rN'.  The 128
floating-point registers are referred to as 'fN'.  The 128 application
registers are referred to as 'arN'.  The 128 control registers are
referred to as 'crN'.  The 64 one-bit predicate registers are referred
to as 'pN'.  The 8 branch registers are referred to as 'bN'.  In
addition, the assembler defines a number of aliases: 'gp' ('r1'), 'sp'
('r12'), 'rp' ('b0'), 'ret0' ('r8'), 'ret1' ('r9'), 'ret2' ('r10'),
'ret3' ('r9'), 'fargN' ('f8+N'), and 'fretN' ('f8+N').

   For convenience, the assembler also defines aliases for all named
application and control registers.  For example, 'ar.bsp' refers to the
register backing store pointer ('ar17').  Similarly, 'cr.eoi' refers to
the end-of-interrupt register ('cr67').

9.15.2.3 IA-64 Processor-Status-Register (PSR) Bit Names
--------------------------------------------------------

The assembler defines bit masks for each of the bits in the IA-64
processor status register.  For example, 'psr.ic' corresponds to a value
of 0x2000.  These masks are primarily intended for use with the
'ssm'/'sum' and 'rsm'/'rum' instructions, but they can be used anywhere
else where an integer constant is expected.

9.15.2.4 Relocations
--------------------

In addition to the standard IA-64 relocations, the following relocations
are implemented by 'as':

'@slotcount(V)'
     Convert the address offset V into a slot count.  This pseudo
     function is available only on VMS. The expression V must be known
     at assembly time: it can't reference undefined symbols or symbols
     in different sections.

9.16.1 IP2K Options
-------------------

The Ubicom IP2K version of 'as' has a few machine dependent options:

'-mip2022ext'
     'as' can assemble the extended IP2022 instructions, but it will
     only do so if this is specifically allowed via this command line
     option.

'-mip2022'
     This option restores the assembler's default behaviour of not
     permitting the extended IP2022 instructions to be assembled.

9.16.2.1 Special Characters
---------------------------

The presence of a ';' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.

   If a '#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The IP2K assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.

9.17.2.2 Relocatable Expression Modifiers
-----------------------------------------

The assembler supports several modifiers when using relocatable
addresses in LM32 instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     modifier(relocatable-expression)

'lo'

     This modifier allows you to use bits 0 through 15 of an address
     expression as 16 bit relocatable expression.

'hi'

     This modifier allows you to use bits 16 through 23 of an address
     expression as 16 bit relocatable expression.

     For example

          ori  r4, r4, lo(sym+10)
          orhi r4, r4, hi(sym+10)

'gp'

     This modified creates a 16-bit relocatable expression that is the
     offset of the symbol from the global pointer.

          mva r4, gp(sym)

'got'

     This modifier places a symbol in the GOT and creates a 16-bit
     relocatable expression that is the offset into the GOT of this
     symbol.

          lw r4, (gp+got(sym))

'gotofflo16'

     This modifier allows you to use the bits 0 through 15 of an address
     which is an offset from the GOT.

'gotoffhi16'

     This modifier allows you to use the bits 16 through 31 of an
     address which is an offset from the GOT.

          orhi r4, r4, gotoffhi16(lsym)
          addi r4, r4, gotofflo16(lsym)

9.17.2.3 Special Characters
---------------------------

The presence of a '#' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.  Note that if a line starts with
a '#' character then it can also be a logical line number directive
(*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
Preprocessing::).

   A semicolon (';') can be used to separate multiple statements on the
same line.

9.18.2.1 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
-----------------------------------

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
M32C instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     %modifier(symbol)

'%dsp8'
'%dsp16'

     These modifiers override the assembler's assumptions about how big
     a symbol's address is.  Normally, when it sees an operand like
     'sym[a0]' it assumes 'sym' may require the widest displacement
     field (16 bits for '-m16c', 24 bits for '-m32c').  These modifiers
     tell it to assume the address will fit in an 8 or 16 bit
     (respectively) unsigned displacement.  Note that, of course, if it
     doesn't actually fit you will get linker errors.  Example:

          mov.w %dsp8(sym)[a0],r1
          mov.b #0,%dsp8(sym)[a0]

'%hi8'

     This modifier allows you to load bits 16 through 23 of a 24 bit
     address into an 8 bit register.  This is useful with, for example,
     the M16C 'smovf' instruction, which expects a 20 bit address in
     'r1h' and 'a0'.  Example:

          mov.b #%hi8(sym),r1h
          mov.w #%lo16(sym),a0
          smovf.b

'%lo16'

     Likewise, this modifier allows you to load bits 0 through 15 of a
     24 bit address into a 16 bit register.

'%hi16'

     This modifier allows you to load bits 16 through 31 of a 32 bit
     address into a 16 bit register.  While the M32C family only has 24
     bits of address space, it does support addresses in pairs of 16 bit
     registers (like 'a1a0' for the 'lde' instruction).  This modifier
     is for loading the upper half in such cases.  Example:

          mov.w #%hi16(sym),a1
          mov.w #%lo16(sym),a0
          ...
          lde.w [a1a0],r1

9.18.2.2 Special Characters
---------------------------

The presence of a ';' character on a line indicates the start of a
comment that extends to the end of that line.

   If a '#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The '|' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.19.1 M32R Options
-------------------

The Renesas M32R version of 'as' has a few machine dependent options:

'-m32rx'
     'as' can assemble code for several different members of the Renesas
     M32R family.  Normally the default is to assemble code for the M32R
     microprocessor.  This option may be used to change the default to
     the M32RX microprocessor, which adds some more instructions to the
     basic M32R instruction set, and some additional parameters to some
     of the original instructions.

'-m32r2'
     This option changes the target processor to the M32R2
     microprocessor.

'-m32r'
     This option can be used to restore the assembler's default
     behaviour of assembling for the M32R microprocessor.  This can be
     useful if the default has been changed by a previous command line
     option.

'-little'
     This option tells the assembler to produce little-endian code and
     data.  The default is dependent upon how the toolchain was
     configured.

'-EL'
     This is a synonym for _-little_.

'-big'
     This option tells the assembler to produce big-endian code and
     data.

'-EB'
     This is a synonym for _-big_.

'-KPIC'
     This option specifies that the output of the assembler should be
     marked as position-independent code (PIC).

'-parallel'
     This option tells the assembler to attempts to combine two
     sequential instructions into a single, parallel instruction, where
     it is legal to do so.

'-no-parallel'
     This option disables a previously enabled _-parallel_ option.

'-no-bitinst'
     This option disables the support for the extended bit-field
     instructions provided by the M32R2.  If this support needs to be
     re-enabled the _-bitinst_ switch can be used to restore it.

'-O'
     This option tells the assembler to attempt to optimize the
     instructions that it produces.  This includes filling delay slots
     and converting sequential instructions into parallel ones.  This
     option implies _-parallel_.

'-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs 'as' to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.  This option is enabled by
     default, but 'gcc' disables it when it invokes 'as' directly.
     Questionable instructions are those whose behaviour would be
     different if they were executed sequentially.  For example the code
     fragment 'mv r1, r2 || mv r3, r1' produces a different result from
     'mv r1, r2 \n mv r3, r1' since the former moves r1 into r3 and then
     r2 into r1, whereas the later moves r2 into r1 and r3.

'-Wp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

'-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs 'as' not to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.

'-Wnp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

'-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option tells the assembler's to stop checking parallel
     instructions for constraint violations.  This ability is provided
     for hardware vendors testing chip designs and should not be used
     under normal circumstances.

'-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option restores the assembler's default behaviour of checking
     parallel instructions to detect constraint violations.

'-Ip'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

'-nIp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

'-warn-unmatched-high'
     This option tells the assembler to produce a warning message if a
     '.high' pseudo op is encountered without a matching '.low' pseudo
     op.  The presence of such an unmatched pseudo op usually indicates
     a programming error.

'-no-warn-unmatched-high'
     Disables a previously enabled _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

'-Wuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

'-Wnuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

9.19.2 M32R Directives
----------------------

The Renesas M32R version of 'as' has a few architecture specific
directives:

'low EXPRESSION'
     The 'low' directive computes the value of its expression and places
     the lower 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of the
     instruction.  For example:

             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = r0 | 0x5678
             add3, r0, r0, #low(fred)   ; compute r0 = r0 + low 16-bits of address of fred

'high EXPRESSION'
     The 'high' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the upper 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             seth  r0, #high(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth, r0, #high(fred)       ; compute r0 = upper 16-bits of address of fred

'shigh EXPRESSION'
     The 'shigh' directive is very similar to the 'high' directive.  It
     also computes the value of its expression and places the upper
     16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of the instruction.
     The difference is that 'shigh' also checks to see if the lower
     16-bits could be interpreted as a signed number, and if so it
     assumes that a borrow will occur from the upper-16 bits.  To
     compensate for this the 'shigh' directive pre-biases the upper 16
     bit value by adding one to it.  For example:

     For example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000) ; compute r0 = 0x00010000

     In the second example the lower 16-bits are 0x8000.  If these are
     treated as a signed value and sign extended to 32-bits then the
     value becomes 0xffff8000.  If this value is then added to
     0x00010000 then the result is 0x00008000.

     This behaviour is to allow for the different semantics of the 'or3'
     and 'add3' instructions.  The 'or3' instruction treats its 16-bit
     immediate argument as unsigned whereas the 'add3' treats its 16-bit
     immediate as a signed value.  So for example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             add3  r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Produces the correct result in r0, whereas:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Stores 0xffff8000 into r0.

     Note - the 'shigh' directive does not know where in the assembly
     source code the lower 16-bits of the value are going set, so it
     cannot check to make sure that an 'or3' instruction is being used
     rather than an 'add3' instruction.  It is up to the programmer to
     make sure that correct directives are used.

'.m32r'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to only accept M32R instructions
     from now on.  An instructions from later M32R architectures are
     refused.

'.m32rx'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32rx_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32RX ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

'.m32r2'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r2_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32R2 ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

'.little'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-little_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start producing
     little-endian code and data.  This option should be used with care
     as producing mixed-endian binary files is fraught with danger.

'.big'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-big_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to start producing big-endian code
     and data.  This option should be used with care as producing
     mixed-endian binary files is fraught with danger.

9.19.3 M32R Warnings
--------------------

There are several warning and error messages that can be produced by
'as' which are specific to the M32R:

'output of 1st instruction is the same as an input to 2nd instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the left hand instruction is used as an input register
     in the right hand instruction.  For example in this code fragment
     'mv r1, r2 || neg r3, r1' register r1 is the destination of the
     move instruction and the input to the neg instruction.

'output of 2nd instruction is the same as an input to 1st instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the right hand instruction is used as an input register
     in the left hand instruction.  For example in this code fragment
     'mv r1, r2 || neg r2, r3' register r2 is the destination of the neg
     instruction and the input to the move instruction.

'instruction '...' is for the M32RX only'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which is only supported by the M32Rx processor, and the
     '-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified to allow assembly
     of such instructions.

'unknown instruction '...''
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which it does not recognize.

'only the NOP instruction can be issued in parallel on the m32r'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which does not involve a NOP instruction and the
     '-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified.  Only the M32Rx
     processor is able to execute two instructions in parallel.

'instruction '...' cannot be executed in parallel.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which is made up of one or two instructions which
     cannot be executed in parallel.

'Instructions share the same execution pipeline'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction whose components both use the same execution pipeline.

'Instructions write to the same destination register.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction where both components attempt to modify the same
     register.  For example these code fragments will produce this
     message: 'mv r1, r2 || neg r1, r3' 'jl r0 || mv r14, r1' 'st r2,
     @-r1 || mv r1, r3' 'mv r1, r2 || ld r0, @r1+' 'cmp r1, r2 || addx
     r3, r4' (Both write to the condition bit)

9.20.1 M680x0 Options
---------------------

The Motorola 680x0 version of 'as' has a few machine dependent options:

'-march=ARCHITECTURE'
     This option specifies a target architecture.  The following
     architectures are recognized: '68000', '68010', '68020', '68030',
     '68040', '68060', 'cpu32', 'isaa', 'isaaplus', 'isab', 'isac' and
     'cfv4e'.

'-mcpu=CPU'
     This option specifies a target cpu.  When used in conjunction with
     the '-march' option, the cpu must be within the specified
     architecture.  Also, the generic features of the architecture are
     used for instruction generation, rather than those of the specific
     chip.

'-m[no-]68851'
'-m[no-]68881'
'-m[no-]div'
'-m[no-]usp'
'-m[no-]float'
'-m[no-]mac'
'-m[no-]emac'

     Enable or disable various architecture specific features.  If a
     chip or architecture by default supports an option (for instance
     '-march=isaaplus' includes the '-mdiv' option), explicitly
     disabling the option will override the default.

'-l'
     You can use the '-l' option to shorten the size of references to
     undefined symbols.  If you do not use the '-l' option, references
     to undefined symbols are wide enough for a full 'long' (32 bits).
     (Since 'as' cannot know where these symbols end up, 'as' can only
     allocate space for the linker to fill in later.  Since 'as' does
     not know how far away these symbols are, it allocates as much space
     as it can.)  If you use this option, the references are only one
     word wide (16 bits).  This may be useful if you want the object
     file to be as small as possible, and you know that the relevant
     symbols are always less than 17 bits away.

'--register-prefix-optional'
     For some configurations, especially those where the compiler
     normally does not prepend an underscore to the names of user
     variables, the assembler requires a '%' before any use of a
     register name.  This is intended to let the assembler distinguish
     between C variables and functions named 'a0' through 'a7', and so
     on.  The '%' is always accepted, but is not required for certain
     configurations, notably 'sun3'.  The '--register-prefix-optional'
     option may be used to permit omitting the '%' even for
     configurations for which it is normally required.  If this is done,
     it will generally be impossible to refer to C variables and
     functions with the same names as register names.

'--bitwise-or'
     Normally the character '|' is treated as a comment character, which
     means that it can not be used in expressions.  The '--bitwise-or'
     option turns '|' into a normal character.  In this mode, you must
     either use C style comments, or start comments with a '#' character
     at the beginning of a line.

'--base-size-default-16 --base-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a base register without
     specifying the size, 'as' will normally use the full 32 bit value.
     For example, the addressing mode '%a0@(%d0)' is equivalent to
     '%a0@(%d0:l)'.  You may use the '--base-size-default-16' option to
     tell 'as' to default to using the 16 bit value.  In this case,
     '%a0@(%d0)' is equivalent to '%a0@(%d0:w)'.  You may use the
     '--base-size-default-32' option to restore the default behaviour.

'--disp-size-default-16 --disp-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a displacement, and the value of
     the displacement is not known, 'as' will normally assume that the
     value is 32 bits.  For example, if the symbol 'disp' has not been
     defined, 'as' will assemble the addressing mode '%a0@(disp,%d0)' as
     though 'disp' is a 32 bit value.  You may use the
     '--disp-size-default-16' option to tell 'as' to instead assume that
     the displacement is 16 bits.  In this case, 'as' will assemble
     '%a0@(disp,%d0)' as though 'disp' is a 16 bit value.  You may use
     the '--disp-size-default-32' option to restore the default
     behaviour.

'--pcrel'
     Always keep branches PC-relative.  In the M680x0 architecture all
     branches are defined as PC-relative.  However, on some processors
     they are limited to word displacements maximum.  When 'as' needs a
     long branch that is not available, it normally emits an absolute
     jump instead.  This option disables this substitution.  When this
     option is given and no long branches are available, only word
     branches will be emitted.  An error message will be generated if a
     word branch cannot reach its target.  This option has no effect on
     68020 and other processors that have long branches.  *note Branch
     Improvement: M68K-Branch.

'-m68000'
     'as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Motorola 680x0 family.  The default depends upon how 'as' was
     configured when it was built; normally, the default is to assemble
     code for the 68020 microprocessor.  The following options may be
     used to change the default.  These options control which
     instructions and addressing modes are permitted.  The members of
     the 680x0 family are very similar.  For detailed information about
     the differences, see the Motorola manuals.

     '-m68000'
     '-m68ec000'
     '-m68hc000'
     '-m68hc001'
     '-m68008'
     '-m68302'
     '-m68306'
     '-m68307'
     '-m68322'
     '-m68356'
          Assemble for the 68000.  '-m68008', '-m68302', and so on are
          synonyms for '-m68000', since the chips are the same from the
          point of view of the assembler.

     '-m68010'
          Assemble for the 68010.

     '-m68020'
     '-m68ec020'
          Assemble for the 68020.  This is normally the default.

     '-m68030'
     '-m68ec030'
          Assemble for the 68030.

     '-m68040'
     '-m68ec040'
          Assemble for the 68040.

     '-m68060'
     '-m68ec060'
          Assemble for the 68060.

     '-mcpu32'
     '-m68330'
     '-m68331'
     '-m68332'
     '-m68333'
     '-m68334'
     '-m68336'
     '-m68340'
     '-m68341'
     '-m68349'
     '-m68360'
          Assemble for the CPU32 family of chips.

     '-m5200'
     '-m5202'
     '-m5204'
     '-m5206'
     '-m5206e'
     '-m521x'
     '-m5249'
     '-m528x'
     '-m5307'
     '-m5407'
     '-m547x'
     '-m548x'
     '-mcfv4'
     '-mcfv4e'
          Assemble for the ColdFire family of chips.

     '-m68881'
     '-m68882'
          Assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the
          default for the 68020, 68030, and the CPU32.  The 68040 and
          68060 always support floating point instructions.

     '-mno-68881'
          Do not assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is
          the default for 68000 and the 68010.  The 68040 and 68060
          always support floating point instructions, even if this
          option is used.

     '-m68851'
          Assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the
          68020, 68030, and 68060.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat
          different set of MMU instructions; '-m68851' and '-m68040'
          should not be used together.

     '-mno-68851'
          Do not assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default
          for the 68000, 68010, and the CPU32.  The 68040 accepts a
          somewhat different set of MMU instructions.

9.20.2 Syntax
-------------

This syntax for the Motorola 680x0 was developed at MIT.

   The 680x0 version of 'as' uses instructions names and syntax
compatible with the Sun assembler.  Intervening periods are ignored; for
example, 'movl' is equivalent to 'mov.l'.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
('%a0' through '%a7'), the program counter ('%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter ('%zpc'), a suppressed address register
('%za0' through '%za7'), or it may be omitted entirely.  The use of SIZE
means one of 'w' or 'l', and it may be omitted, along with the leading
colon, unless a scale is also specified.  The use of SCALE means one of
'1', '2', '4', or '8', and it may always be omitted along with the
leading colon.

   The following addressing modes are understood:
"Immediate"
     '#NUMBER'

"Data Register"
     '%d0' through '%d7'

"Address Register"
     '%a0' through '%a7'
     '%a7' is also known as '%sp', i.e., the Stack Pointer.  '%a6' is
     also known as '%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Indirect"
     '%a0@' through '%a7@'

"Address Register Postincrement"
     '%a0@+' through '%a7@+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     '%a0@-' through '%a7@-'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     'APC@(NUMBER)'

"Index"
     'APC@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.

"Postindex"
     'APC@(NUMBER)@(ONUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The ONUMBER or the REGISTER, but not both, may be omitted.

"Preindex"
     'APC@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)@(ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.  Omitting the REGISTER produces the
     Postindex addressing mode.

"Absolute"
     'SYMBOL', or 'DIGITS', optionally followed by ':b', ':w', or ':l'.

9.20.3 Motorola Syntax
----------------------

The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (*note Syntax: M68K-Syntax.).  'as' can accept
Motorola syntax for operands, even if MIT syntax is used for other
operands in the same instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are fully
compatible.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
('%a0' through '%a7'), the program counter ('%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter ('%zpc'), or a suppressed address
register ('%za0' through '%za7').  The use of SIZE means one of 'w' or
'l', and it may always be omitted along with the leading dot.  The use
of SCALE means one of '1', '2', '4', or '8', and it may always be
omitted along with the leading asterisk.

   The following additional addressing modes are understood:

"Address Register Indirect"
     '(%a0)' through '(%a7)'
     '%a7' is also known as '%sp', i.e., the Stack Pointer.  '%a6' is
     also known as '%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Postincrement"
     '(%a0)+' through '(%a7)+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     '-(%a0)' through '-(%a7)'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     'NUMBER(%A0)' through 'NUMBER(%A7)', or 'NUMBER(%PC)'.

     The NUMBER may also appear within the parentheses, as in
     '(NUMBER,%A0)'.  When used with the PC, the NUMBER may be omitted
     (with an address register, omitting the NUMBER produces Address
     Register Indirect mode).

"Index"
     'NUMBER(APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted, or it may appear within the parentheses.
     The APC may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC may appear in
     either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address registers, and
     the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first register is taken as
     the base register, and the second as the index register.

"Postindex"
     '([NUMBER,APC],REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE,ONUMBER)'

     The ONUMBER, or the REGISTER, or both, may be omitted.  Either the
     NUMBER or the APC may be omitted, but not both.

"Preindex"
     '([NUMBER,APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE],ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER, or the APC, or the REGISTER, or any two of them, may be
     omitted.  The ONUMBER may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC may
     appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the index
     register.

9.20.4 Floating Point
---------------------

Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

'.float'
     'Single' precision floating point constants.

'.double'
     'Double' precision floating point constants.

'.extend'
'.ldouble'
     'Extended' precision ('long double') floating point constants.

9.20.5 680x0 Machine Directives
-------------------------------

In order to be compatible with the Sun assembler the 680x0 assembler
understands the following directives.

'.data1'
     This directive is identical to a '.data 1' directive.

'.data2'
     This directive is identical to a '.data 2' directive.

'.even'
     This directive is a special case of the '.align' directive; it
     aligns the output to an even byte boundary.

'.skip'
     This directive is identical to a '.space' directive.

'.arch NAME'
     Select the target architecture and extension features.  Valid
     values for NAME are the same as for the '-march' command line
     option.  This directive cannot be specified after any instructions
     have been assembled.  If it is given multiple times, or in
     conjunction with the '-march' option, all uses must be for the same
     architecture and extension set.

'.cpu NAME'
     Select the target cpu.  Valid values for NAME are the same as for
     the '-mcpu' command line option.  This directive cannot be
     specified after any instructions have been assembled.  If it is
     given multiple times, or in conjunction with the '-mopt' option,
     all uses must be for the same cpu.

9.20.6.1 Branch Improvement
---------------------------

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting 'j' for 'b' at the
start of a Motorola mnemonic.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.  A '*' flags
cases that are more fully described after the table:

               Displacement
               +------------------------------------------------------------
               |                68020           68000/10, not PC-relative OK
     Pseudo-Op |BYTE    WORD    LONG            ABSOLUTE LONG JUMP    **
               +------------------------------------------------------------
          jbsr |bsrs    bsrw    bsrl            jsr
           jra |bras    braw    bral            jmp
     *     jXX |bXXs    bXXw    bXXl            bNXs;jmp
     *    dbXX | N/A    dbXXw   dbXX;bras;bral  dbXX;bras;jmp
          fjXX | N/A    fbXXw   fbXXl            N/A

     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX

                    '*'--see full description below
         '**'--this expansion mode is disallowed by '--pcrel'

'jbsr'
'jra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.  This instruction will be a byte or word
     branch is that is sufficient.  Otherwise, a long branch will be
     emitted if available.  If no long branches are available and the
     '--pcrel' option is not given, an absolute long jump will be
     emitted instead.  If no long branches are available, the '--pcrel'
     option is given, and a word branch cannot reach the target, an
     error message is generated.

     In addition to standard branch operands, 'as' allows these
     pseudo-operations to have all operands that are allowed for jsr and
     jmp, substituting these instructions if the operand given is not
     valid for a branch instruction.

'jXX'
     Here, 'jXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations, where
     XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full list
     of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jhi   jls   jcc   jcs   jne   jeq   jvc
           jvs   jpl   jmi   jge   jlt   jgt   jle

     Usually, each of these pseudo-operations expands to a single branch
     instruction.  However, if a word branch is not sufficient, no long
     branches are available, and the '--pcrel' option is not given, 'as'
     issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX, the opposite
     condition to XX.  For example, under these conditions:
              jXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

'dbXX'
     The full family of pseudo-operations covered here is
           dbhi   dbls   dbcc   dbcs   dbne   dbeq   dbvc
           dbvs   dbpl   dbmi   dbge   dblt   dbgt   dble
           dbf    dbra   dbt

     Motorola 'dbXX' instructions allow word displacements only.  When a
     word displacement is sufficient, each of these pseudo-operations
     expands to the corresponding Motorola instruction.  When a word
     displacement is not sufficient and long branches are available,
     when the source reads 'dbXX foo', 'as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:bral foo
           oo2:

     If, however, long branches are not available and the '--pcrel'
     option is not given, 'as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:jmp foo
           oo2:

'fjXX'
     This family includes
           fjne   fjeq   fjge   fjlt   fjgt   fjle   fjf
           fjt    fjgl   fjgle  fjnge  fjngl  fjngle fjngt
           fjnle  fjnlt  fjoge  fjogl  fjogt  fjole  fjolt
           fjor   fjseq  fjsf   fjsne  fjst   fjueq  fjuge
           fjugt  fjule  fjult  fjun

     Each of these pseudo-operations always expands to a single Motorola
     coprocessor branch instruction, word or long.  All Motorola
     coprocessor branch instructions allow both word and long
     displacements.

9.20.6.2 Special Characters
---------------------------

Line comments are introduced by the '|' character appearing anywhere on
a line, unless the '--bitwise-or' command line option has been
specified.

   An asterisk ('*') as the first character on a line marks the start of
a line comment as well.

   A hash character ('#') as the first character on a line also marks
the start of a line comment, but in this case it could also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).  If the hash character appears
elsewhere on a line it is used to introduce an immediate value.  (This
is for compatibility with Sun's assembler).

   Multiple statements on the same line can appear if they are separated
by the ';' character.

9.21.1 M68HC11 and M68HC12 Options
----------------------------------

The Motorola 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of 'as' have a few machine
dependent options.

'-m68hc11'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HC11 mode.  In this
     mode, the assembler only accepts 68HC11 operands and mnemonics.  It
     produces code for the 68HC11.

'-m68hc12'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HC12 mode.  In this
     mode, the assembler also accepts 68HC12 operands and mnemonics.  It
     produces code for the 68HC12.  A few 68HC11 instructions are
     replaced by some 68HC12 instructions as recommended by Motorola
     specifications.

'-m68hcs12'
     This option switches the assembler into the M68HCS12 mode.  This
     mode is similar to '-m68hc12' but specifies to assemble for the
     68HCS12 series.  The only difference is on the assembling of the
     'movb' and 'movw' instruction when a PC-relative operand is used.

'-mm9s12x'
     This option switches the assembler into the M9S12X mode.  This mode
     is similar to '-m68hc12' but specifies to assemble for the S12X
     series which is a superset of the HCS12.

'-mm9s12xg'
     This option switches the assembler into the XGATE mode for the RISC
     co-processor featured on some S12X-family chips.

'--xgate-ramoffset'
     This option instructs the linker to offset RAM addresses from S12X
     address space into XGATE address space.

'-mshort'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 16-bit integer
     ABI. It has no effect on the assembled instructions.  This is the
     default.

'-mlong'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit integer
     ABI.

'-mshort-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float
     ABI. This is the default.

'-mlong-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float
     ABI.

'--strict-direct-mode'
     You can use the '--strict-direct-mode' option to disable the
     automatic translation of direct page mode addressing into extended
     mode when the instruction does not support direct mode.  For
     example, the 'clr' instruction does not support direct page mode
     addressing.  When it is used with the direct page mode, 'as' will
     ignore it and generate an absolute addressing.  This option
     prevents 'as' from doing this, and the wrong usage of the direct
     page mode will raise an error.

'--short-branches'
     The '--short-branches' option turns off the translation of relative
     branches into absolute branches when the branch offset is out of
     range.  By default 'as' transforms the relative branch ('bsr',
     'bgt', 'bge', 'beq', 'bne', 'ble', 'blt', 'bhi', 'bcc', 'bls',
     'bcs', 'bmi', 'bvs', 'bvs', 'bra') into an absolute branch when the
     offset is out of the -128 ..  127 range.  In that case, the 'bsr'
     instruction is translated into a 'jsr', the 'bra' instruction is
     translated into a 'jmp' and the conditional branches instructions
     are inverted and followed by a 'jmp'.  This option disables these
     translations and 'as' will generate an error if a relative branch
     is out of range.  This option does not affect the optimization
     associated to the 'jbra', 'jbsr' and 'jbXX' pseudo opcodes.

'--force-long-branches'
     The '--force-long-branches' option forces the translation of
     relative branches into absolute branches.  This option does not
     affect the optimization associated to the 'jbra', 'jbsr' and 'jbXX'
     pseudo opcodes.

'--print-insn-syntax'
     You can use the '--print-insn-syntax' option to obtain the syntax
     description of the instruction when an error is detected.

'--print-opcodes'
     The '--print-opcodes' option prints the list of all the
     instructions with their syntax.  The first item of each line
     represents the instruction name and the rest of the line indicates
     the possible operands for that instruction.  The list is printed in
     alphabetical order.  Once the list is printed 'as' exits.

'--generate-example'
     The '--generate-example' option is similar to '--print-opcodes' but
     it generates an example for each instruction instead.

9.21.2 Syntax
-------------

In the M68HC11 syntax, the instruction name comes first and it may be
followed by one or several operands (up to three).  Operands are
separated by comma (',').  In the normal mode, 'as' will complain if too
many operands are specified for a given instruction.  In the MRI mode
(turned on with '-M' option), it will treat them as comments.  Example:

     inx
     lda  #23
     bset 2,x #4
     brclr *bot #8 foo

   The presence of a ';' character or a '!' character anywhere on a line
indicates the start of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   A '*' or a '#' character at the start of a line also introduces a
line comment, but these characters do not work elsewhere on the line.
If the first character of the line is a '#' then as well as starting a
comment, the line could also be logical line number directive (*note
Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The M68HC11 assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.

   The following addressing modes are understood for 68HC11 and 68HC12:
"Immediate"
     '#NUMBER'

"Address Register"
     'NUMBER,X', 'NUMBER,Y'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.

"Direct Addressing mode"
     '*SYMBOL', or '*DIGITS'

"Absolute"
     'SYMBOL', or 'DIGITS'

   The M68HC12 has other more complex addressing modes.  All of them are
supported and they are represented below:

"Constant Offset Indexed Addressing Mode"
     'NUMBER,REG'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.  The register
     can be either 'X', 'Y', 'SP' or 'PC'.  The assembler will use the
     smaller post-byte definition according to the constant value (5-bit
     constant offset, 9-bit constant offset or 16-bit constant offset).
     If the constant is not known by the assembler it will use the
     16-bit constant offset post-byte and the value will be resolved at
     link time.

"Offset Indexed Indirect"
     '[NUMBER,REG]'

     The register can be either 'X', 'Y', 'SP' or 'PC'.

"Auto Pre-Increment/Pre-Decrement/Post-Increment/Post-Decrement"
     'NUMBER,-REG' 'NUMBER,+REG' 'NUMBER,REG-' 'NUMBER,REG+'

     The number must be in the range '-8'..'+8' and must not be 0.  The
     register can be either 'X', 'Y', 'SP' or 'PC'.

"Accumulator Offset"
     'ACC,REG'

     The accumulator register can be either 'A', 'B' or 'D'.  The
     register can be either 'X', 'Y', 'SP' or 'PC'.

"Accumulator D offset indexed-indirect"
     '[D,REG]'

     The register can be either 'X', 'Y', 'SP' or 'PC'.

   For example:

     ldab 1024,sp
     ldd [10,x]
     orab 3,+x
     stab -2,y-
     ldx a,pc
     sty [d,sp]

9.21.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
---------------------------------

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
68HC11 and 68HC12 instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     %modifier(symbol)

'%addr'
     This modifier indicates to the assembler and linker to use the
     16-bit physical address corresponding to the symbol.  This is
     intended to be used on memory window systems to map a symbol in the
     memory bank window.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion part,
     the physical address corresponds to the symbol address within the
     memory bank window.  If the symbol is not in a memory expansion
     part, this is the symbol address (using or not using the %addr
     modifier has no effect in that case).

'%page'
     This modifier indicates to use the memory page number corresponding
     to the symbol.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, its
     page number is computed by the linker as a number used to map the
     page containing the symbol in the memory bank window.  If the
     symbol is not in a memory expansion part, the page number is 0.

'%hi'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit high part of the physical
     address of the symbol.

'%lo'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit low part of the physical
     address of the symbol.

   For example a 68HC12 call to a function 'foo_example' stored in
memory expansion part could be written as follows:

     call %addr(foo_example),%page(foo_example)

   and this is equivalent to

     call foo_example

   And for 68HC11 it could be written as follows:

     ldab #%page(foo_example)
     stab _page_switch
     jsr  %addr(foo_example)

9.21.4 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

The 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of 'as' have the following specific
assembler directives:

'.relax'
     The relax directive is used by the 'GNU Compiler' to emit a
     specific relocation to mark a group of instructions for linker
     relaxation.  The sequence of instructions within the group must be
     known to the linker so that relaxation can be performed.

'.mode [mshort|mlong|mshort-double|mlong-double]'
     This directive specifies the ABI. It overrides the '-mshort',
     '-mlong', '-mshort-double' and '-mlong-double' options.

'.far SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as a 'far' symbol meaning that it
     uses a 'call/rtc' calling convention as opposed to 'jsr/rts'.
     During a final link, the linker will identify references to the
     'far' symbol and will verify the proper calling convention.

'.interrupt SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as an interrupt entry point.  This
     information is then used by the debugger to correctly unwind the
     frame across interrupts.

'.xrefb SYMBOL'
     This directive is defined for compatibility with the 'Specification
     for Motorola 8 and 16-Bit Assembly Language Input Standard' and is
     ignored.

9.21.5 Floating Point
---------------------

Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

'.float'
     'Single' precision floating point constants.

'.double'
     'Double' precision floating point constants.

'.extend'
'.ldouble'
     'Extended' precision ('long double') floating point constants.

9.21.6.1 Branch Improvement
---------------------------

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by prepending 'j' to the start of
Motorola mnemonic.  These pseudo opcodes are not affected by the
'--short-branches' or '--force-long-branches' options.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.

     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX


'jbsr'
'jbra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.

'jbXX'
     Here, 'jbXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jbcc   jbeq   jbge   jbgt   jbhi   jbvs   jbpl  jblo
           jbcs   jbne   jblt   jble   jbls   jbvc   jbmi

     For the cases of non-PC relative displacements and long
     displacements, 'as' issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX,
     the opposite condition to XX.  For example, for the non-PC relative
     case:
              jbXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

9.22.2 Syntax
-------------

In the S12Z syntax, the instruction name comes first and it may be
followed by one or by several operands.  In most cases the maximum
number of operands is three.  Some instructions accept and (in certain
situations require) a suffix indicating the size of the operand.  The
suffix is separated from the instruction name by a period ('.') and may
be one of 'b', 'w', 'p' or 'l' indicating 'byte' (a single byte), 'word'
(2 bytes), 'pointer' (3 bytes) or 'long' (4 bytes) respectively.
Operands are separated by a comma (',').  A comma however does not act
as a separator if it appears within parentheses ('()') or within square
brackets ('[]').  'as' will complain if too many, too few or
inappropriate operands are specified for a given instruction.  The MRI
mode is not supported for this architecture.  Example:

     	bset.b  0xA98, #5
     	mov.b   #6, 0x2409
     	ld      d0, #4
     	mov.l   (d0, x), 0x2409
     	inc     d0
     	cmp     d0, #12
     	blt     *-4
     	lea     x, 0x2409
     	st      y,  (1, x)

   The presence of a ';' character anywhere on a line indicates the
start of a comment that extends to the end of that line.

   A '*' or a '#' character at the start of a line also introduces a
line comment, but these characters do not work elsewhere on the line.
If the first character of the line is a '#' then as well as starting a
comment, the line could also be logical line number directive (*note
Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The S12Z assembler does not currently support a line separator
character.

   The following addressing modes are understood for the S12Z.
"Immediate"
     '#NUMBER'

"Immediate Bit Field"
     '#WIDTH:OFFSET'

     Bit field instructions in the immediate mode require the width and
     offset to be specified.  The WIDTH pararmeter specifies the number
     of bits in the field.  It should be a number in the range [1,32].
     OFFSET determines the position within the field where the operation
     should start.  It should be a number in the range [0,31].

"Relative"
     '*SYMBOL', or '*[+-]DIGITS'

     Program counter relative addresses have a width of 15 bits.  Thus,
     they must be within the range [-32768, 32767].

"Register"
     'REG'

     Some instructions accept a register as an operand.  In general, REG
     may be a data register ('D0', 'D1' ... 'D7'), the X register or the
     Y register.

     A few instructions accept as an argument the stack pointer register
     ('S'), and/or the program counter ('P').

     Some very special instructions accept arguments which refer to the
     condition code register.  For these arguments the syntax is 'CCR',
     'CCH' or 'CCL' which refer to the complete condition code register,
     the condition code register high byte and the condition code
     register low byte respectively.

"Absolute Direct"
     'SYMBOL', or 'DIGITS'

"Absolute Indirect"
     '[SYMBOL', or 'DIGITS]'

"Constant Offset Indexed"
     '(NUMBER,REG)'

     REG may be either 'X', 'Y', 'S' or 'P' or one of the data registers
     'D0', 'D1' ... 'D7'.  If any of the registers 'D2' ... 'D5' are
     specified, then the register value is treated as a signed value.
     Otherwise it is treated as unsigned.  NUMBER may be any integer in
     the range [-8388608,8388607].

"Offset Indexed Indirect"
     '[NUMBER,REG]'

     REG may be either 'X', 'Y', 'S' or 'P'.  NUMBER may be any integer
     in the range [-8388608,8388607].

"Auto Pre-Increment/Pre-Decrement/Post-Increment/Post-Decrement"
     '-REG', '+REG', 'REG-' or 'REG+'

     This addressing mode is typically used to access a value at an
     address, and simultaneously to increment/decrement the register
     pointing to that address.  Thus REG may be any of the 24 bit
     registers 'X', 'Y', or 'S'.  Pre-increment and post-decrement are
     not available for register 'S' (only post-increment and
     pre-decrement are available).

"Register Offset Direct"
     '(DATA-REG,REG)'

     REG can be either 'X', 'Y', or 'S'.  DATA-REG must be one of the
     data registers 'D0', 'D1' ... 'D7'.  If any of the registers 'D2'
     ... 'D5' are specified, then the register value is treated as a
     signed value.  Otherwise it is treated as unsigned.

"Register Offset Indirect"
     '[DATA-REG,REG]'

     REG can be either 'X' or 'Y'.  DATA-REG must be one of the data
     registers 'D0', 'D1' ... 'D7'.  If any of the registers 'D2' ...
     'D5' are specified, then the register value is treated as a signed
     value.  Otherwise it is treated as unsigned.

   For example:

     	trap    #197
     	bra     *+49
     	bra     .L0
     	jmp     0xFE0034
     	jmp     [0xFD0012]
     	inc.b   (4,x)
     	dec.w   [4,y]
     	clr.p   (-s)
     	neg.l   (d0, s)
     	com.b   [d1, x]
     	jsr     (45, d0)
     	psh     cch

     assembled into an 16-bit value.

'.data32 EXPRESSION,...'
     This directive is an alias for '.word'.  Each expression is
     assembled into an 32-bit value.

'.ent NAME[,LABEL]'
     This directive is an alias for '.func' denoting the start of
     function NAME at (optional) LABEL.

'.end NAME[,LABEL]'
     This directive is an alias for '.endfunc' denoting the end of
     function NAME.

'.gpword LABEL,...'
     This directive is an alias for '.rva'.  The resolved address of
     LABEL is stored in the data section.

'.weakext LABEL'
     Declare that LABEL is a weak external symbol.

9.24.2.1 Special Characters
---------------------------

The presence of a '#' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.

   If a '#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The ';' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.25.1 Assembler options
------------------------

The MIPS configurations of GNU 'as' support these special options:

'-G NUM'
     Set the "small data" limit to N bytes.  The default limit is 8
     bytes.  *Note Controlling the use of small data accesses: MIPS
     Small Data.

'-EB'
'-EL'
     Any MIPS configuration of 'as' can select big-endian or
     little-endian output at run time (unlike the other GNU development
     tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use '-EB'
     to select big-endian output, and '-EL' for little-endian.

'-KPIC'
     Generate SVR4-style PIC. This option tells the assembler to
     generate SVR4-style position-independent macro expansions.  It also
     tells the assembler to mark the output file as PIC.

'-mvxworks-pic'
     Generate VxWorks PIC. This option tells the assembler to generate
     VxWorks-style position-independent macro expansions.

'-mips1'
'-mips2'
'-mips3'
'-mips4'
'-mips5'
'-mips32'
'-mips32r2'
'-mips32r3'
'-mips32r5'
'-mips32r6'
'-mips64'
'-mips64r2'
'-mips64r3'
'-mips64r5'
'-mips64r6'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
     level.  '-mips1' corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
     '-mips2' to the R6000 processor, '-mips3' to the R4000 processor,
     and '-mips4' to the R8000 and R10000 processors.  '-mips5',
     '-mips32', '-mips32r2', '-mips32r3', '-mips32r5', '-mips32r6',
     '-mips64', '-mips64r2', '-mips64r3', '-mips64r5', and '-mips64r6'
     correspond to generic MIPS V, MIPS32, MIPS32 Release 2, MIPS32
     Release 3, MIPS32 Release 5, MIPS32 Release 6, MIPS64, and MIPS64
     Release 2, MIPS64 Release 3, MIPS64 Release 5, and MIPS64 Release 6
     ISA processors, respectively.  You can also switch instruction sets
     during the assembly; see *note Directives to override the ISA
     level: MIPS ISA.

'-mgp32'
'-mfp32'
     Some macros have different expansions for 32-bit and 64-bit
     registers.  The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA
     and ABI, but these flags force a certain group of registers to be
     treated as 32 bits wide at all times.  '-mgp32' controls the size
     of general-purpose registers and '-mfp32' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

     The '.set gp=32' and '.set fp=32' directives allow the size of
     registers to be changed for parts of an object.  The default value
     is restored by '.set gp=default' and '.set fp=default'.

     On some MIPS variants there is a 32-bit mode flag; when this flag
     is set, 64-bit instructions generate a trap.  Also, some 32-bit
     OSes only save the 32-bit registers on a context switch, so it is
     essential never to use the 64-bit registers.

'-mgp64'
'-mfp64'
     Assume that 64-bit registers are available.  This is provided in
     the interests of symmetry with '-mgp32' and '-mfp32'.

     The '.set gp=64' and '.set fp=64' directives allow the size of
     registers to be changed for parts of an object.  The default value
     is restored by '.set gp=default' and '.set fp=default'.

'-mfpxx'
     Make no assumptions about whether 32-bit or 64-bit floating-point
     registers are available.  This is provided to support having
     modules compatible with either '-mfp32' or '-mfp64'.  This option
     can only be used with MIPS II and above.

     The '.set fp=xx' directive allows a part of an object to be marked
     as not making assumptions about 32-bit or 64-bit FP registers.  The
     default value is restored by '.set fp=default'.

'-modd-spreg'
'-mno-odd-spreg'
     Enable use of floating-point operations on odd-numbered
     single-precision registers when supported by the ISA. '-mfpxx'
     implies '-mno-odd-spreg', otherwise the default is '-modd-spreg'

'-mips16'
'-no-mips16'
     Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting '.module mips16' at the start of the assembly file.
     '-no-mips16' turns off this option.

'-mmips16e2'
'-mno-mips16e2'
     Enable the use of MIPS16e2 instructions in MIPS16 mode.  This is
     equivalent to putting '.module mips16e2' at the start of the
     assembly file.  '-mno-mips16e2' turns off this option.

'-mmicromips'
'-mno-micromips'
     Generate code for the microMIPS processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting '.module micromips' at the start of the assembly file.
     '-mno-micromips' turns off this option.  This is equivalent to
     putting '.module nomicromips' at the start of the assembly file.

'-msmartmips'
'-mno-smartmips'
     Enables the SmartMIPS extensions to the MIPS32 instruction set,
     which provides a number of new instructions which target smartcard
     and cryptographic applications.  This is equivalent to putting
     '.module smartmips' at the start of the assembly file.
     '-mno-smartmips' turns off this option.

'-mips3d'
'-no-mips3d'
     Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.  '-no-mips3d'
     turns off this option.

'-mdmx'
'-no-mdmx'
     Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  '-no-mdmx' turns
     off this option.

'-mdsp'
'-mno-dsp'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 1 Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept DSP Release 1 instructions.
     '-mno-dsp' turns off this option.

'-mdspr2'
'-mno-dspr2'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 2 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies '-mdsp'.  This tells the assembler to accept
     DSP Release 2 instructions.  '-mno-dspr2' turns off this option.

'-mdspr3'
'-mno-dspr3'
     Generate code for the DSP Release 3 Application Specific Extension.
     This option implies '-mdsp' and '-mdspr2'.  This tells the
     assembler to accept DSP Release 3 instructions.  '-mno-dspr3' turns
     off this option.

'-mmt'
'-mno-mt'
     Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MT instructions.  '-mno-mt' turns off
     this option.

'-mmcu'
'-mno-mcu'
     Generate code for the MCU Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MCU instructions.  '-mno-mcu' turns
     off this option.

'-mmsa'
'-mno-msa'
     Generate code for the MIPS SIMD Architecture Extension.  This tells
     the assembler to accept MSA instructions.  '-mno-msa' turns off
     this option.

'-mxpa'
'-mno-xpa'
     Generate code for the MIPS eXtended Physical Address (XPA)
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept XPA instructions.
     '-mno-xpa' turns off this option.

'-mvirt'
'-mno-virt'
     Generate code for the Virtualization Application Specific
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept Virtualization
     instructions.  '-mno-virt' turns off this option.

'-mcrc'
'-mno-crc'
     Generate code for the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) Application
     Specific Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept CRC
     instructions.  '-mno-crc' turns off this option.

'-mginv'
'-mno-ginv'
     Generate code for the Global INValidate (GINV) Application Specific
     Extension.  This tells the assembler to accept GINV instructions.
     '-mno-ginv' turns off this option.

'-minsn32'
'-mno-insn32'
     Only use 32-bit instruction encodings when generating code for the
     microMIPS processor.  This option inhibits the use of any 16-bit
     instructions.  This is equivalent to putting '.set insn32' at the
     start of the assembly file.  '-mno-insn32' turns off this option.
     This is equivalent to putting '.set noinsn32' at the start of the
     assembly file.  By default '-mno-insn32' is selected, allowing all
     instructions to be used.

'-mfix7000'
'-mno-fix7000'
     Cause nops to be inserted if the read of the destination register
     of an mfhi or mflo instruction occurs in the following two
     instructions.

'-mfix-rm7000'
'-mno-fix-rm7000'
     Cause nops to be inserted if a dmult or dmultu instruction is
     followed by a load instruction.

'-mfix-loongson2f-jump'
'-mno-fix-loongson2f-jump'
     Eliminate instruction fetch from outside 256M region to work around
     the Loongson2F 'jump' instructions.  Without it, under extreme
     cases, the kernel may crash.  The issue has been solved in latest
     processor batches, but this fix has no side effect to them.

'-mfix-loongson2f-nop'
'-mno-fix-loongson2f-nop'
     Replace nops by 'or at,at,zero' to work around the Loongson2F 'nop'
     errata.  Without it, under extreme cases, the CPU might deadlock.
     The issue has been solved in later Loongson2F batches, but this fix
     has no side effect to them.

'-mfix-vr4120'
'-mno-fix-vr4120'
     Insert nops to work around certain VR4120 errata.  This option is
     intended to be used on GCC-generated code: it is not designed to
     catch all problems in hand-written assembler code.

'-mfix-vr4130'
'-mno-fix-vr4130'
     Insert nops to work around the VR4130 'mflo'/'mfhi' errata.

'-mfix-24k'
'-mno-fix-24k'
     Insert nops to work around the 24K 'eret'/'deret' errata.

'-mfix-cn63xxp1'
'-mno-fix-cn63xxp1'
     Replace 'pref' hints 0 - 4 and 6 - 24 with hint 28 to work around
     certain CN63XXP1 errata.

'-m4010'
'-no-m4010'
     Generate code for the LSI R4010 chip.  This tells the assembler to
     accept the R4010-specific instructions ('addciu', 'ffc', etc.), and
     to not schedule 'nop' instructions around accesses to the 'HI' and
     'LO' registers.  '-no-m4010' turns off this option.

'-m4650'
'-no-m4650'
     Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler to
     accept the 'mad' and 'madu' instruction, and to not schedule 'nop'
     instructions around accesses to the 'HI' and 'LO' registers.
     '-no-m4650' turns off this option.

'-m3900'
'-no-m3900'
'-m4100'
'-no-m4100'
     For each option '-mNNNN', generate code for the MIPS RNNNN chip.
     This tells the assembler to accept instructions specific to that
     chip, and to schedule for that chip's hazards.

'-march=CPU'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS CPU. It is exactly equivalent
     to '-mCPU', except that there are more value of CPU understood.
     Valid CPU value are:

          2000, 3000, 3900, 4000, 4010, 4100, 4111, vr4120, vr4130,
          vr4181, 4300, 4400, 4600, 4650, 5000, rm5200, rm5230, rm5231,
          rm5261, rm5721, vr5400, vr5500, 6000, rm7000, 8000, rm9000,
          10000, 12000, 14000, 16000, 4kc, 4km, 4kp, 4ksc, 4kec, 4kem,
          4kep, 4ksd, m4k, m4kp, m14k, m14kc, m14ke, m14kec, 24kc,
          24kf2_1, 24kf, 24kf1_1, 24kec, 24kef2_1, 24kef, 24kef1_1,
          34kc, 34kf2_1, 34kf, 34kf1_1, 34kn, 74kc, 74kf2_1, 74kf,
          74kf1_1, 74kf3_2, 1004kc, 1004kf2_1, 1004kf, 1004kf1_1,
          interaptiv, interaptiv-mr2, m5100, m5101, p5600, 5kc, 5kf,
          20kc, 25kf, sb1, sb1a, i6400, p6600, loongson2e, loongson2f,
          loongson3a, octeon, octeon+, octeon2, octeon3, xlr, xlp

     For compatibility reasons, 'Nx' and 'Bfx' are accepted as synonyms
     for 'Nf1_1'.  These values are deprecated.

'-mtune=CPU'
     Schedule and tune for a particular MIPS CPU. Valid CPU values are
     identical to '-march=CPU'.

'-mabi=ABI'
     Record which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments
     are: '32', 'n32', 'o64', '64' and 'eabi'.

'-msym32'
'-mno-sym32'
     Equivalent to adding '.set sym32' or '.set nosym32' to the
     beginning of the assembler input.  *Note MIPS Symbol Sizes::.

'-nocpp'
     This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line
     compatibility with other assemblers, which use it to turn off C
     style preprocessing.  With GNU 'as', there is no need for '-nocpp',
     because the GNU assembler itself never runs the C preprocessor.

'-msoft-float'
'-mhard-float'
     Disable or enable floating-point instructions.  Note that by
     default floating-point instructions are always allowed even with
     CPU targets that don't have support for these instructions.

'-msingle-float'
'-mdouble-float'
     Disable or enable double-precision floating-point operations.  Note
     that by default double-precision floating-point operations are
     always allowed even with CPU targets that don't have support for
     these operations.

'--construct-floats'
'--no-construct-floats'
     The '--no-construct-floats' option disables the construction of
     double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of
     the value into the two single width floating point registers that
     make up the double width register.  This feature is useful if the
     processor support the FR bit in its status register, and this bit
     is known (by the programmer) to be set.  This bit prevents the
     aliasing of the double width register by the single width
     registers.

     By default '--construct-floats' is selected, allowing construction
     of these floating point constants.

'--relax-branch'
'--no-relax-branch'
     The '--relax-branch' option enables the relaxation of out-of-range
     branches.  Any branches whose target cannot be reached directly are
     converted to a small instruction sequence including an
     inverse-condition branch to the physically next instruction, and a
     jump to the original target is inserted between the two
     instructions.  In PIC code the jump will involve further
     instructions for address calculation.

     The 'BC1ANY2F', 'BC1ANY2T', 'BC1ANY4F', 'BC1ANY4T', 'BPOSGE32' and
     'BPOSGE64' instructions are excluded from relaxation, because they
     have no complementing counterparts.  They could be relaxed with the
     use of a longer sequence involving another branch, however this has
     not been implemented and if their target turns out of reach, they
     produce an error even if branch relaxation is enabled.

     Also no MIPS16 branches are ever relaxed.

     By default '--no-relax-branch' is selected, causing any
     out-of-range branches to produce an error.

'-mignore-branch-isa'
'-mno-ignore-branch-isa'
     Ignore branch checks for invalid transitions between ISA modes.

     The semantics of branches does not provide for an ISA mode switch,
     so in most cases the ISA mode a branch has been encoded for has to
     be the same as the ISA mode of the branch's target label.  If the
     ISA modes do not match, then such a branch, if taken, will cause
     the ISA mode to remain unchanged and instructions that follow will
     be executed in the wrong ISA mode causing the program to misbehave
     or crash.

     In the case of the 'BAL' instruction it may be possible to relax it
     to an equivalent 'JALX' instruction so that the ISA mode is
     switched at the run time as required.  For other branches no
     relaxation is possible and therefore GAS has checks implemented
     that verify in branch assembly that the two ISA modes match, and
     report an error otherwise so that the problem with code can be
     diagnosed at the assembly time rather than at the run time.

     However some assembly code, including generated code produced by
     some versions of GCC, may incorrectly include branches to data
     labels, which appear to require a mode switch but are either dead
     or immediately followed by valid instructions encoded for the same
     ISA the branch has been encoded for.  While not strictly correct at
     the source level such code will execute as intended, so to help
     with these cases '-mignore-branch-isa' is supported which disables
     ISA mode checks for branches.

     By default '-mno-ignore-branch-isa' is selected, causing any
     invalid branch requiring a transition between ISA modes to produce
     an error.

'-mnan=ENCODING'
     This option indicates whether the source code uses the IEEE 2008
     NaN encoding ('-mnan=2008') or the original MIPS encoding
     ('-mnan=legacy').  It is equivalent to adding a '.nan' directive to
     the beginning of the source file.  *Note MIPS NaN Encodings::.

     '-mnan=legacy' is the default if no '-mnan' option or '.nan'
     directive is used.

'--trap'
'--no-break'
     'as' automatically macro expands certain division and
     multiplication instructions to check for overflow and division by
     zero.  This option causes 'as' to generate code to take a trap
     exception rather than a break exception when an error is detected.
     The trap instructions are only supported at Instruction Set
     Architecture level 2 and higher.

'--break'
'--no-trap'
     Generate code to take a break exception rather than a trap
     exception when an error is detected.  This is the default.

'-mpdr'
'-mno-pdr'
     Control generation of '.pdr' sections.  Off by default on IRIX, on
     elsewhere.

'-mshared'
'-mno-shared'
     When generating code using the Unix calling conventions (selected
     by '-KPIC' or '-mcall_shared'), gas will normally generate code
     which can go into a shared library.  The '-mno-shared' option tells
     gas to generate code which uses the calling convention, but can not
     go into a shared library.  The resulting code is slightly more
     efficient.  This option only affects the handling of the '.cpload'
     and '.cpsetup' pseudo-ops.

9.25.2 High-level assembly macros
---------------------------------

MIPS assemblers have traditionally provided a wider range of
instructions than the MIPS architecture itself.  These extra
instructions are usually referred to as "macro" instructions (1).

   Some MIPS macro instructions extend an underlying architectural
instruction while others are entirely new.  An example of the former
type is 'and', which allows the third operand to be either a register or
an arbitrary immediate value.  Examples of the latter type include
'bgt', which branches to the third operand when the first operand is
greater than the second operand, and 'ulh', which implements an
unaligned 2-byte load.

   One of the most common extensions provided by macros is to expand
memory offsets to the full address range (32 or 64 bits) and to allow
symbolic offsets such as 'my_data + 4' to be used in place of integer
constants.  For example, the architectural instruction 'lbu' allows only
a signed 16-bit offset, whereas the macro 'lbu' allows code such as 'lbu
$4,array+32769($5)'.  The implementation of these symbolic offsets
depends on several factors, such as whether the assembler is generating
SVR4-style PIC (selected by '-KPIC', *note Assembler options: MIPS
Options.), the size of symbols (*note Directives to override the size of
symbols: MIPS Symbol Sizes.), and the small data limit (*note
Controlling the use of small data accesses: MIPS Small Data.).

   Sometimes it is undesirable to have one assembly instruction expand
to several machine instructions.  The directive '.set nomacro' tells the
assembler to warn when this happens.  '.set macro' restores the default
behavior.

   Some macro instructions need a temporary register to store
intermediate results.  This register is usually '$1', also known as
'$at', but it can be changed to any core register REG using '.set
at=REG'.  Note that '$at' always refers to '$1' regardless of which
register is being used as the temporary register.

   Implicit uses of the temporary register in macros could interfere
with explicit uses in the assembly code.  The assembler therefore warns
whenever it sees an explicit use of the temporary register.  The
directive '.set noat' silences this warning while '.set at' restores the
default behavior.  It is safe to use '.set noat' while '.set nomacro' is
in effect since single-instruction macros never need a temporary
register.

   Note that while the GNU assembler provides these macros for
compatibility, it does not make any attempt to optimize them with the
surrounding code.

   (1) The term "macro" is somewhat overloaded here, since these macros
have no relation to those defined by '.macro', *note '.macro': Macro.

9.25.3 Directives to override the size of symbols
-------------------------------------------------

The n64 ABI allows symbols to have any 64-bit value.  Although this
provides a great deal of flexibility, it means that some macros have
much longer expansions than their 32-bit counterparts.  For example, the
non-PIC expansion of 'dla $4,sym' is usually:

     lui     $4,%highest(sym)
     lui     $1,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%higher(sym)
     daddiu  $1,$1,%lo(sym)
     dsll32  $4,$4,0
     daddu   $4,$4,$1

   whereas the 32-bit expansion is simply:

     lui     $4,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(sym)

   n64 code is sometimes constructed in such a way that all symbolic
constants are known to have 32-bit values, and in such cases, it's
preferable to use the 32-bit expansion instead of the 64-bit expansion.

   You can use the '.set sym32' directive to tell the assembler that,
from this point on, all expressions of the form 'SYMBOL' or 'SYMBOL +
OFFSET' have 32-bit values.  For example:

     .set sym32
     dla     $4,sym
     lw      $4,sym+16
     sw      $4,sym+0x8000($4)

   will cause the assembler to treat 'sym', 'sym+16' and 'sym+0x8000' as
32-bit values.  The handling of non-symbolic addresses is not affected.

   The directive '.set nosym32' ends a '.set sym32' block and reverts to
the normal behavior.  It is also possible to change the symbol size
using the command-line options '-msym32' and '-mno-sym32'.

   These options and directives are always accepted, but at present,
they have no effect for anything other than n64.

9.25.4 Controlling the use of small data accesses
-------------------------------------------------

It often takes several instructions to load the address of a symbol.
For example, when 'addr' is a 32-bit symbol, the non-PIC expansion of
'dla $4,addr' is usually:

     lui     $4,%hi(addr)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(addr)

   The sequence is much longer when 'addr' is a 64-bit symbol.  *Note
Directives to override the size of symbols: MIPS Symbol Sizes.

   In order to cut down on this overhead, most embedded MIPS systems set
aside a 64-kilobyte "small data" area and guarantee that all data of
size N and smaller will be placed in that area.  The limit N is passed
to both the assembler and the linker using the command-line option '-G
N', *note Assembler options: MIPS Options.  Note that the same value of
N must be used when linking and when assembling all input files to the
link; any inconsistency could cause a relocation overflow error.

   The size of an object in the '.bss' section is set by the '.comm' or
'.lcomm' directive that defines it.  The size of an external object may
be set with the '.extern' directive.  For example, '.extern sym,4'
declares that the object at 'sym' is 4 bytes in length, while leaving
'sym' otherwise undefined.

   When no '-G' option is given, the default limit is 8 bytes.  The
option '-G 0' prevents any data from being automatically classified as
small.

   It is also possible to mark specific objects as small by putting them
in the special sections '.sdata' and '.sbss', which are "small"
counterparts of '.data' and '.bss' respectively.  The toolchain will
treat such data as small regardless of the '-G' setting.

   On startup, systems that support a small data area are expected to
initialize register '$28', also known as '$gp', in such a way that small
data can be accessed using a 16-bit offset from that register.  For
example, when 'addr' is small data, the 'dla $4,addr' instruction above
is equivalent to:

     daddiu  $4,$28,%gp_rel(addr)

   Small data is not supported for SVR4-style PIC.

9.25.5 Directives to override the ISA level
-------------------------------------------

GNU 'as' supports an additional directive to change the MIPS Instruction
Set Architecture level on the fly: '.set mipsN'.  N should be a number
from 0 to 5, or 32, 32r2, 32r3, 32r5, 32r6, 64, 64r2, 64r3, 64r5 or
64r6.  The values other than 0 make the assembler accept instructions
for the corresponding ISA level, from that point on in the assembly.
'.set mipsN' affects not only which instructions are permitted, but also
how certain macros are expanded.  '.set mips0' restores the ISA level to
its original level: either the level you selected with command line
options, or the default for your configuration.  You can use this
feature to permit specific MIPS III instructions while assembling in 32
bit mode.  Use this directive with care!

   The '.set arch=CPU' directive provides even finer control.  It
changes the effective CPU target and allows the assembler to use
instructions specific to a particular CPU. All CPUs supported by the
'-march' command line option are also selectable by this directive.  The
original value is restored by '.set arch=default'.

   The directive '.set mips16' puts the assembler into MIPS 16 mode, in
which it will assemble instructions for the MIPS 16 processor.  Use
'.set nomips16' to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

   The directive '.set micromips' puts the assembler into microMIPS
mode, in which it will assemble instructions for the microMIPS
processor.  Use '.set nomicromips' to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

9.25.6 Directives to control code generation
--------------------------------------------

The '.module' directive allows command line options to be set directly
from assembly.  The format of the directive matches the '.set' directive
but only those options which are relevant to a whole module are
supported.  The effect of a '.module' directive is the same as the
corresponding command line option.  Where '.set' directives support
returning to a default then the '.module' directives do not as they
define the defaults.

   These module-level directives must appear first in assembly.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

   The directive '.set insn32' makes the assembler only use 32-bit
instruction encodings when generating code for the microMIPS processor.
This directive inhibits the use of any 16-bit instructions from that
point on in the assembly.  The '.set noinsn32' directive allows 16-bit
instructions to be accepted.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

9.25.7 Directives for extending MIPS 16 bit instructions
--------------------------------------------------------

By default, MIPS 16 instructions are automatically extended to 32 bits
when necessary.  The directive '.set noautoextend' will turn this off.
When '.set noautoextend' is in effect, any 32 bit instruction must be
explicitly extended with the '.e' modifier (e.g., 'li.e $4,1000').  The
directive '.set autoextend' may be used to once again automatically
extend instructions when necessary.

   This directive is only meaningful when in MIPS 16 mode.  Traditional
MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.

9.25.8 Directive to mark data as an instruction
-----------------------------------------------

The '.insn' directive tells 'as' that the following data is actually
instructions.  This makes a difference in MIPS 16 and microMIPS modes:
when loading the address of a label which precedes instructions, 'as'
automatically adds 1 to the value, so that jumping to the loaded address
will do the right thing.

   The '.global' and '.globl' directives supported by 'as' will by
default mark the symbol as pointing to a region of data not code.  This
means that, for example, any instructions following such a symbol will
not be disassembled by 'objdump' as it will regard them as data.  To
change this behavior an optional section name can be placed after the
symbol name in the '.global' directive.  If this section exists and is
known to be a code section, then the symbol will be marked as pointing
at code not data.  Ie the syntax for the directive is:

   '.global SYMBOL[ SECTION][, SYMBOL[ SECTION]] ...',

   Here is a short example:

             .global foo .text, bar, baz .data
     foo:
             nop
     bar:
             .word 0x0
     baz:
             .word 0x1

9.25.9.1 History of FP ABIs
---------------------------

The MIPS ABIs support a variety of different floating-point extensions
where calling-convention and register sizes vary for floating-point
data.  The extensions exist to support a wide variety of optional
architecture features.  The resulting ABI variants are generally
incompatible with each other and must be tracked carefully.

   Traditionally the use of an explicit '.gnu_attribute 4, N' directive
is used to indicate which ABI is in use by a specific module.  It was
then left to the user to ensure that command line options and the
selected ABI were compatible with some potential for inconsistencies.

9.25.9.2 Supported FP ABIs
--------------------------

The supported floating-point ABI variants are:

'0 - No floating-point'
     This variant is used to indicate that floating-point is not used
     within the module at all and therefore has no impact on the ABI.
     This is the default.

'1 - Double-precision'
     This variant indicates that double-precision support is used.  For
     64-bit ABIs this means that 64-bit wide floating-point registers
     are required.  For 32-bit ABIs this means that 32-bit wide
     floating-point registers are required and double-precision
     operations use pairs of registers.

'2 - Single-precision'
     This variant indicates that single-precision support is used.
     Double precision operations will be supported via soft-float
     routines.

'3 - Soft-float'
     This variant indicates that although floating-point support is used
     all operations are emulated in software.  This means the ABI is
     modified to pass all floating-point data in general-purpose
     registers.

'4 - Deprecated'
     This variant existed as an initial attempt at supporting 64-bit
     wide floating-point registers for O32 ABI on a MIPS32r2 CPU. This
     has been superseded by 5, 6 and 7.

'5 - Double-precision 32-bit CPU, 32-bit or 64-bit FPU'
     This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the
     floating-point code in the module has been designed to operate
     correctly with either 32-bit wide or 64-bit wide floating-point
     registers.  Double-precision support is used.  Only O32 currently
     supports this variant and requires a minimum architecture of MIPS
     II.

'6 - Double-precision 32-bit FPU, 64-bit FPU'
     This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the
     floating-point code in the module requires 64-bit wide
     floating-point registers.  Double-precision support is used.  Only
     O32 currently supports this variant and requires a minimum
     architecture of MIPS32r2.

'7 - Double-precision compat 32-bit FPU, 64-bit FPU'
     This variant is used by 32-bit ABIs to indicate that the
     floating-point code in the module requires 64-bit wide
     floating-point registers.  Double-precision support is used.  This
     differs from the previous ABI as it restricts use of odd-numbered
     single-precision registers.  Only O32 currently supports this
     variant and requires a minimum architecture of MIPS32r2.

9.25.9.3 Automatic selection of FP ABI
--------------------------------------

In order to simplify and add safety to the process of selecting the
correct floating-point ABI, the assembler will automatically infer the
correct '.gnu_attribute 4, N' directive based on command line options
and '.module' overrides.  Where an explicit '.gnu_attribute 4, N'
directive has been seen then a warning will be raised if it does not
match an inferred setting.

   The floating-point ABI is inferred as follows.  If '-msoft-float' has
been used the module will be marked as soft-float.  If '-msingle-float'
has been used then the module will be marked as single-precision.  The
remaining ABIs are then selected based on the FP register width.
Double-precision is selected if the width of GP and FP registers match
and the special double-precision variants for 32-bit ABIs are then
selected depending on '-mfpxx', '-mfp64' and '-mno-odd-spreg'.

9.25.9.4 Linking different FP ABI variants
------------------------------------------

Modules using the default FP ABI (no floating-point) can be linked with
any other (singular) FP ABI variant.

   Special compatibility support exists for O32 with the four
double-precision FP ABI variants.  The '-mfpxx' FP ABI is specifically
designed to be compatible with the standard double-precision ABI and the
'-mfp64' FP ABIs.  This makes it desirable for O32 modules to be built
as '-mfpxx' to ensure the maximum compatibility with other modules
produced for more specific needs.  The only FP ABIs which cannot be
linked together are the standard double-precision ABI and the full
'-mfp64' ABI with '-modd-spreg'.

9.25.10 Directives to record which NaN encoding is being used
-------------------------------------------------------------

The IEEE 754 floating-point standard defines two types of not-a-number
(NaN) data: "signalling" NaNs and "quiet" NaNs.  The original version of
the standard did not specify how these two types should be
distinguished.  Most implementations followed the i387 model, in which
the first bit of the significand is set for quiet NaNs and clear for
signalling NaNs.  However, the original MIPS implementation assigned the
opposite meaning to the bit, so that it was set for signalling NaNs and
clear for quiet NaNs.

   The 2008 revision of the standard formally suggested the i387 choice
and as from Sep 2012 the current release of the MIPS architecture
therefore optionally supports that form.  Code that uses one NaN
encoding would usually be incompatible with code that uses the other NaN
encoding, so MIPS ELF objects have a flag ('EF_MIPS_NAN2008') to record
which encoding is being used.

   Assembly files can use the '.nan' directive to select between the two
encodings.  '.nan 2008' says that the assembly file uses the IEEE
754-2008 encoding while '.nan legacy' says that the file uses the
original MIPS encoding.  If several '.nan' directives are given, the
final setting is the one that is used.

   The command-line options '-mnan=legacy' and '-mnan=2008' can be used
instead of '.nan legacy' and '.nan 2008' respectively.  However, any
'.nan' directive overrides the command-line setting.

   '.nan legacy' is the default if no '.nan' directive or '-mnan' option
is given.

   Note that GNU 'as' does not produce NaNs itself and therefore these
directives do not affect code generation.  They simply control the
setting of the 'EF_MIPS_NAN2008' flag.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

9.25.11 Directives to save and restore options
----------------------------------------------

The directives '.set push' and '.set pop' may be used to save and
restore the current settings for all the options which are controlled by
'.set'.  The '.set push' directive saves the current settings on a
stack.  The '.set pop' directive pops the stack and restores the
settings.

   These directives can be useful inside an macro which must change an
option such as the ISA level or instruction reordering but does not want
to change the state of the code which invoked the macro.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

9.25.14.1 Special Characters
----------------------------

The presence of a '#' on a line indicates the start of a comment that
extends to the end of the current line.

   If a '#' appears as the first character of a line, the whole line is
treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a logical
line number directive (*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control
command (*note Preprocessing::).

   The ';' character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.

9.26.1 Command-line Options
---------------------------

The MMIX version of 'as' has some machine-dependent options.

   When '--fixed-special-register-names' is specified, only the register
names specified in *note MMIX-Regs:: are recognized in the instructions
'PUT' and 'GET'.

   You can use the '--globalize-symbols' to make all symbols global.
This option is useful when splitting up a 'mmixal' program into several
files.

   The '--gnu-syntax' turns off most syntax compatibility with 'mmixal'.
Its usability is currently doubtful.

   The '--relax' option is not fully supported, but will eventually make
the object file prepared for linker relaxation.

   If you want to avoid inadvertently calling a predefined symbol and
would rather get an error, for example when using 'as' with a compiler
or other machine-generated code, specify '--no-predefined-syms'.  This
turns off built-in predefined definitions of all such symbols, including
rounding-mode symbols, segment symbols, 'BIT' symbols, and 'TRAP'
symbols used in 'mmix' "system calls".  It also turns off predefined
special-register names, except when used in 'PUT' and 'GET'
instructions.

   By default, some instructions are expanded to fit the size of the
operand or an external symbol (*note MMIX-Expand::).  By passing
'--no-expand', no such expansion will be done, instead causing errors at
link time if the operand does not fit.

   The 'mmixal' documentation (*note mmixsite::) specifies that global
registers allocated with the 'GREG' directive (*note MMIX-greg::) and
initialized to the same non-zero value, will refer to the same global
register.  This isn't strictly enforceable in 'as' since the final
addresses aren't known until link-time, but it will do an effort unless
the '--no-merge-gregs' option is specified.  (Register merging isn't yet
implemented in 'ld'.)

   'as' will warn every time it expands an instruction to fit an operand
unless the option '-x' is specified.  It is believed that this behaviour
is more useful than just mimicking 'mmixal''s behaviour, in which
instructions are only expanded if the '-x' option is specified, and
assembly fails otherwise, when an instruction needs to be expanded.  It
needs to be kept in mind that 'mmixal' is both an assembler and linker,
while 'as' will expand instructions that at link stage can be
contracted.  (Though linker relaxation isn't yet implemented in 'ld'.)
The option '-x' also implies '--linker-allocated-gregs'.

   If instruction expansion is enabled, 'as' can expand a 'PUSHJ'
instruction into a series of instructions.  The shortest expansion is to
not expand it, but just mark the call as redirectable to a stub, which
'ld' creates at link-time, but only if the original 'PUSHJ' instruction
is found not to reach the target.  The stub consists of the necessary
instructions to form a jump to the target.  This happens if 'as' can
assert that the 'PUSHJ' instruction can reach such a stub.  The option
'--no-pushj-stubs' disables this shorter expansion, and the longer
series of instructions is then created at assembly-time.  The option
'--no-stubs' is a synonym, intended for compatibility with future
releases, where generation of stubs for other instructions may be
implemented.

   Usually a two-operand-expression (*note GREG-base::) without a
matching 'GREG' directive is treated as an error by 'as'.  When the
option '--linker-allocated-gregs' is in effect, they are instead passed
through to the linker, which will allocate as many global registers as
is needed.

9.26.2 Instruction expansion
----------------------------

When 'as' encounters an instruction with an operand that is either not
known or does not fit the operand size of the instruction, 'as' (and
'ld') will expand the instruction into a sequence of instructions
semantically equivalent to the operand fitting the instruction.
Expansion will take place for the following instructions:

'GETA'
     Expands to a sequence of four instructions: 'SETL', 'INCML',
     'INCMH' and 'INCH'.  The operand must be a multiple of four.
Conditional branches
     A branch instruction is turned into a branch with the complemented
     condition and prediction bit over five instructions; four
     instructions setting '$255' to the operand value, which like with
     'GETA' must be a multiple of four, and a final 'GO $255,$255,0'.
'PUSHJ'
     Similar to expansion for conditional branches; four instructions
     set '$255' to the operand value, followed by a 'PUSHGO
     $255,$255,0'.
'JMP'
     Similar to conditional branches and 'PUSHJ'.  The final instruction
     is 'GO $255,$255,0'.

   The linker 'ld' is expected to shrink these expansions for code
assembled with '--relax' (though not currently implemented).

9.26.3 Syntax
-------------

The assembly syntax is supposed to be upward compatible with that
described in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of 'The Art of Computer Programming,
Volume 1'.  Draft versions of those chapters as well as other MMIX
information is located at
<http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html>.  Most code
examples from the mmixal package located there should work unmodified
when assembled and linked as single files, with a few noteworthy
exceptions (*note MMIX-mmixal::).

   Before an instruction is emitted, the current location is aligned to
the next four-byte boundary.  If a label is defined at the beginning of
the line, its value will be the aligned value.

   In addition to the traditional hex-prefix '0x', a hexadecimal number
can also be specified by the prefix character '#'.

   After all operands to an MMIX instruction or directive have been
specified, the rest of the line is ignored, treated as a comment.

9.26.3.1 Special Characters
---------------------------

The characters '*' and '#' are line comment characters; each start a
comment at the beginning of a line, but only at the beginning of a line.
A '#' prefixes a hexadecimal number if found elsewhere on a line.  If a
'#' appears at the start of a line the whole line is treated as a
comment, but the line can also act as a logical line number directive
(*note Comments::) or a preprocessor control command (*note
Preprocessing::).

   Two other characters, '%' and '!', each start a comment anywhere on
the line.  Thus you can't use the 'modulus' and 'not' operators in
expressions normally associated with these two characters.

   A ';' is a line separator, treated as a new-line, so separate
instructions can be specified on a single line.

9.26.3.2 Symbols
----------------

The character ':' is permitted in identifiers.  There are two exceptions
to it being treated as any other symbol character: if a symbol begins
with ':', it means that the symbol is in the global namespace and that
the current prefix should not be prepended to that symbol (*note
MMIX-prefix::).  The ':' is then not considered part of the symbol.  For
a symbol in the label position (first on a line), a ':' at the end of a
symbol is silently stripped off.  A label is permitted, but not
required, to be followed by a ':', as with many other assembly formats.

   The character '@' in an expression, is a synonym for '.', the current
location.

   In addition to the common forward and backward local symbol formats
(*note Symbol Names::), they can be specified with upper-case 'B' and
'F', as in '8B' and '9F'.  A local label defined for the current
position is written with a 'H' appended to the number:
     3H LDB $0,$1,2
   This and traditional local-label formats cannot be mixed: a label
must be defined and referred to using the same format.

   There's a minor caveat: just as for the ordinary local symbols, the
local symbols are translated into ordinary symbols using control
characters are to hide the ordinal number of the symbol.  Unfortunately,
these symbols are not translated back in error messages.  Thus you may
see confusing error messages when local symbols are used.  Control
characters '\003' (control-C) and '\004' (control-D) are used for the
MMIX-specific local-symbol syntax.

   The symbol 'Main' is handled specially; it is always global.

   By defining the symbols '__.MMIX.start..text' and
'__.MMIX.start..data', the address of respectively the '.text' and
'.data' segments of the final program can be defined, though when
linking more than one object file, the code or data in the object file
containing the symbol is not guaranteed to be start at that position;
just the final executable.  *Note MMIX-loc::.

9.26.3.3 Register names
-----------------------

Local and global registers are specified as '$0' to '$255'.  The
recognized special register names are 'rJ', 'rA', 'rB', 'rC', 'rD',
'rE', 'rF', 'rG', 'rH', 'rI', 'rK', 'rL', 'rM', 'rN', 'rO', 'rP', 'rQ',
'rR', 'rS', 'rT', 'rU', 'rV', 'rW', 'rX', 'rY', 'rZ', 'rBB', 'rTT',
'rWW', 'rXX', 'rYY' and 'rZZ'.  A leading ':' is optional for special
register names.

   Local and global symbols can be equated to register names and used in
place of ordinary registers.

   Similarly for special registers, local and global symbols can be
used.  Also, symbols equated from numbers and constant expressions are
allowed in place of a special register, except when either of the
options '--no-predefined-syms' and '--fixed-special-register-names' are
specified.  Then only the special register names above are allowed for
the instructions having a special register operand; 'GET' and 'PUT'.

9.26.3.4 Assembler Directives
-----------------------------

'LOC'

     The 'LOC' directive sets the current location to the value of the
     operand field, which may include changing sections.  If the operand
     is a constant, the section is set to either '.data' if the value is
     '0x2000000000000000' or larger, else it is set to '.text'.  Within
     a section, the current location may only be changed to
     monotonically higher addresses.  A LOC expression must be a
     previously defined symbol or a "pure" constant.

     An example, which sets the label PREV to the current location, and
     updates the current location to eight bytes forward:
          prev LOC @+8

     When a LOC has a constant as its operand, a symbol
     '__.MMIX.start..text' or '__.MMIX.start..data' is defined depending
     on the address as mentioned above.  Each such symbol is interpreted
     as special by the linker, locating the section at that address.
     Note that if multiple files are linked, the first object file with
     that section will be mapped to that address (not necessarily the
     file with the LOC definition).

'LOCAL'

     Example:
           LOCAL external_symbol
           LOCAL 42
           .local asymbol

     This directive-operation generates a link-time assertion that the
     operand does not correspond to a global register.  The operand is
     an expression that at link-time resolves to a register symbol or a
     number.  A number is treated as the register having that number.
     There is one restriction on the use of this directive: the
     pseudo-directive must be placed in a section with contents, code or
     data.

'IS'

     The 'IS' directive:
          asymbol IS an_expression
     sets the symbol 'asymbol' to 'an_expression'.  A symbol may not be
     set more than once using this directive.  Local labels may be set
     using this directive, for example:
          5H IS @+4

'GREG'

     This directive reserves a global register, gives it an initial
     value and optionally gives it a symbolic name.  Some examples:

          areg GREG
          breg GREG data_value
               GREG data_buffer
               .greg creg, another_data_value

     The symbolic register name can be used in place of a (non-special)
     register.  If a value isn't provided, it defaults to zero.  Unless
     the option '--no-merge-gregs' is specified, non-zero registers
     allocated with this directive may be eliminated by 'as'; another
     register with the same value used in its place.  Any of the
     instructions 'CSWAP', 'GO', 'LDA', 'LDBU', 'LDB', 'LDHT', 'LDOU',
     'LDO', 'LDSF', 'LDTU', 'LDT', 'LDUNC', 'LDVTS', 'LDWU', 'LDW',
     'PREGO', 'PRELD', 'PREST', 'PUSHGO', 'STBU', 'STB', 'STCO', 'STHT',
     'STOU', 'STSF', 'STTU', 'STT', 'STUNC', 'SYNCD', 'SYNCID', can have
     a value nearby an initial value in place of its second and third
     operands.  Here, "nearby" is defined as within the range 0...255
     from the initial value of such an allocated register.

          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
           GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,buffer2
     In the example above, the 'Y' field of the 'LDOUI' instruction
     (LDOU with a constant Z) will be replaced with the global register
     allocated for 'buffer1', and the 'Z' field will have the value 5,
     the offset from 'buffer1' to 'buffer2'.  The result is equivalent
     to this code:
          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
          tmpreg GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,tmpreg,(buffer2-buffer1)

     Global registers allocated with this directive are allocated in
     order higher-to-lower within a file.  Other than that, the exact
     order of register allocation and elimination is undefined.  For
     example, the order is undefined when more than one file with such
     directives are linked together.  With the options '-x' and
     '--linker-allocated-gregs', 'GREG' directives for two-operand cases
     like the one mentioned above can be omitted.  Sufficient global
     registers will then be allocated by the linker.

'BYTE'

     The 'BYTE' directive takes a series of operands separated by a
     comma.  If an operand is a string (*note Strings::), each character
     of that string is emitted as a byte.  Other operands must be
     constant expressions without forward references, in the range
     0...255.  If you need operands having expressions with forward
     references, use '.byte' (*note Byte::).  An operand can be omitted,
     defaulting to a zero value.

'WYDE'
'TETRA'
'OCTA'

     The directives 'WYDE', 'TETRA' and 'OCTA' emit constants of two,
     four and eight bytes size respectively.  Before anything else
     happens for the directive, the current location is aligned to the
     respective constant-size boundary.  If a label is defined at the
     beginning of the line, its value will be that after the alignment.
     A single operand can be omitted, defaulting to a zero value emitted
     for the directive.  Operands can be expressed as strings (*note
     Strings::), in which case each character in the string is emitted
     as a separate constant of the size indicated by the directive.

'PREFIX'

     The 'PREFIX' directive sets a symbol name prefix to be prepended to
     all symbols (except local symbols, *note MMIX-Symbols::), that are
     not prefixed with ':', until the next 'PREFIX' directive.  Such
     prefixes accumulate.  For example,
           PREFIX a
           PREFIX b
          c IS 0
     defines a symbol 'abc' with the value 0.

'BSPEC'
'ESPEC'

     A pair of 'BSPEC' and 'ESPEC' directives delimit a section of
     special contents (without specified semantics).  Example:
           BSPEC 42
           TETRA 1,2,3
           ESPEC
     The single operand to 'BSPEC' must be number in the range 0...255.
     The 'BSPEC' number 80 is used by the GNU binutils implementation.

9.26.4 Differences to 'mmixal'
------------------------------

The binutils 'as' and 'ld' combination has a few differences in function
compared to 'mmixal' (*note mmixsite::).

   The replacement of a symbol with a GREG-allocated register (*note
GREG-base::) is not handled the exactly same way in 'as' as in 'mmixal'.
This is apparent in the 'mmixal' example file 'inout.mms', where
different registers with different offsets, eventually yielding the same
address, are used in the first instruction.  This type of difference
should however not affect the function of any program unless it has
specific assumptions about the allocated register number.

   Line numbers (in the 'mmo' object format) are currently not
supported.

   Expression operator precedence is not that of mmixal: operator
precedence is that of the C programming language.  It's recommended to
use parentheses to explicitly specify wanted operator precedence
whenever more than one type of operators are used.

   The serialize unary operator '&', the fractional division operator
'//', the logical not operator '!' and the modulus operator '%' are not
available.

   Symbols are not global by default, unless the option
'--globalize-symbols' is passed.  Use the '.global' directive to
globalize symbols (*note Global::).

   Operand syntax is a bit stricter with 'as' than 'mmixal'.  For
example, you can't say 'addu 1,2,3', instead you must write 'addu
$1,$2,3'.

   You can't LOC to a lower address than those already visited (i.e.,
"backwards").

   A LOC directive must come before any emitted code.

   Predefined symbols are visible as file-local symbols after use.  (In
the ELF file, that is--the linked mmo file has no notion of a file-local
symbol.)

   Some mapping of constant expressions to sections in LOC expressions
is attempted, but that functionality is easily confused and should be
avoided unless compatibility with 'mmixal' is required.  A LOC
expression to '0x2000000000000000' or higher, maps to the '.data'
section and lower addresses map to the '.text' section (*note
MMIX-loc::).

   The code and data areas are each contiguous.  Sparse programs with
far-away LOC directives will take up the same amount of space as a
contiguous program with zeros filled in the gaps between the LOC
directives.  If you need sparse programs, you might try and get the
wanted effect with a linker script and splitting up the code parts into
sections (*note Section::).  Assembly code for this, to be compatible
with 'mmixal', would look something like:
      .if 0
      LOC away_expression
      .else
      .section away,"ax"
      .fi
   'as' will not execute the LOC directive and 'mmixal' ignores the
lines with '.'.  This construct can be used generally to help
compatibility.

   Symbols can't be defined twice-not even to the same value.

   Instruction mnemonics are recognized case-insensitive, though the
'IS' and 'GREG' pseudo-operations must be specified in upper-case
characters.

   There's no unicode support.

   The following is a list of programs in 'mmix.tar.gz', available at
<http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html>, last checked
with the version dated 2001-08-25 (md5sum
c393470cfc86fac040487d22d2bf0172) that assemble with 'mmixal' but do not
assemble with 'as':

'silly.mms'
     LOC to a previous address.
'sim.mms'
     Redefines symbol 'Done'.
'test.mms'
     Uses the serial operator '&'.

9.27.1 Options
--------------

'-mmcu'
     selects the mcu architecture.  If the architecture is 430Xv2 then
     this also enables NOP generation unless the '-mN' is also
     specified.

'-mcpu'
     selects the cpu architecture.  If the architecture is 430Xv2 then
     this also enables NOP generation unless the '-mN' is also
     specified.

'-msilicon-errata=NAME[,NAME...]'
     Implements a fixup for named silicon errata.  Multiple silicon
     errata can be specified by multiple uses of the '-msilicon-errata'
     option and/or by including the errata names, separated by commas,
     on an individual '-msilicon-errata' option.  Errata names currently
     recognised by the assembler are:

     'cpu4'
          'PUSH #4' and 'PUSH #8' need longer encodings on the MSP430.
          This option is enabled by default, and cannot be disabled.
     'cpu8'
          Do not set the 'SP' to an odd value.
     'cpu11'
          Do not update the 'SR' and the 'PC' in the same instruction.
     'cpu12'
          Do not use the 'PC' in a 'CMP' or 'BIT' instruction.
     'cpu13'
          Do not use an arithmetic instruction to modify the 'SR'.
     'cpu19'
          Insert 'NOP' after 'CPUOFF'.

'-msilicon-errata-warn=NAME[,NAME...]'
     Like the '-msilicon-errata' option except that instead of fixing
     the specified errata, a warning message is issued instead.  This
     option can be used alongside '-msilicon-errata' to generate
     messages whenever a problem is fixed, or on its own in order to
     inspect code for potential problems.

'-mP'
     enables polymorph instructions handler.

'-mQ'
     enables relaxation at assembly time.  DANGEROUS!

'-ml'
     indicates that the input uses the large code model.

'-mn'
     enables the generation of a NOP instruction following any
     instruction that might change the interrupts enabled/disabled
     state.  The pipelined nature of the MSP430 core means that any
     instruction that changes the interrupt state ('EINT', 'DINT', 'BIC
     #8, SR', 'BIS #8, SR' or 'MOV.W <>, SR') must be followed by a NOP
     instruction in order to ensure the correct processing of
     interrupts.  By default it is up to the programmer to supply these
     NOP instructions, but this command line option enables the
     automatic insertion by the assembler, if they are missing.

'-mN'
     disables the generation of a NOP instruction following any
     instruction that might change the interrupts enabled/disabled
     state.  This is the default behaviour.

'-my'
     tells the assembler to generate a warning message if a NOP does not
     immediately follow an instruction that enables or disables
     interrupts.  This is the default.

     Note that this option can be stacked with the '-mn' option so that
